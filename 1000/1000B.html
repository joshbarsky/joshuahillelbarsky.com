the martyr<br> 
from a nap.  out into the yard… 
<p>
in a tree socket,
presumably <br>this was self inflicted… a courageous sacrifice 
</p>
<p>a reconciled purpose<br> without a price. <br>on a three hour walk
decided to share a slurpee from 7-11
and eat dinner at home
</p>

the trees have begun 
<br>
the dogs and the trash cans themselves

I can see now what is happening 

<br>the dust the shelf at the electronics store 
<br>

what seemed like a sudden gust of wind 
was more than a proverbial sweep of the broom 
<p>

I will try to be patient as this passes 

but I must admit –– I have begun to feel slightly anxious 
</p>
<p>
There is still dirt behind my ear 
from  a bucket of kimchi in the ground
<br>
I was so nervous about leaving the kimchi behind that I ate my fingernail off.
It shed onto the ground like snakeskin. 
 
I would have dug the kimchi back out and perhaps even eaten all of it in one sitting.


So in a way I am glad 
…the longer I am here, the better the kimchi will taste when I return. 
</p>
<p>


The small plastic garbage can
waits patiently 
in the corner of the room 
while the light breaks off the wall 
but eventually
the time will come 
when it too 
must throw itself
away.

the list goes on…………………………………………………………..

I eat chips and watch many shows on tv, one after another.

The list goes on...

asphalt 
<br> some people say that the luxury ones  look the best
while other people prefer a more colloquial feeling

<p>a house for sale a few blocks away  –– not only the roof but also on the stairs leading up to the front door…

the house was quite small 
and any choice may be suitable at the end of the day
<br>
I am wondering how to make some money next week perhaps a box of computer keyboards fell off the back of the truck into the loading dock and into the sewer they went down through the muck until they arrived 
<p>
I saw an air purifier, 
it was hard to tell if it was broken or not… 
but maybe someone would find it useful one day
–– I climbed down to get it
<br>
when I was down there I had a moment of self reflection –– a wave of gratitude came over me,

it’s hard to explain why it seemed so deeply meaningful and if I'm being honest, I will admit that I became quite emotional  
<br>
I’ve been very lucky to have this air purifier… 
<br>who would have guessed that I would have been the one who needed it in the end
<br>
next time I hope to pay better attention and not out into my feelings like that 

<p>
watching the hanging of F<br>
The general consensus seemed to be in favour of his execution... but there were still a handful of protestors there. 

I didn't join them but I do believe that given the right circumstance, Friedrich could have changed his behaviour eventually. 
<br>

before Friedrich died I watched him whisper something to the executioner. 

I mostly forgot about all of this 

<p>
I was sitting at my desk thinking things over 
<br>
I ended up watching a tutorial online about cleaning up glass.

The person in the video showed a basic dustpan and broom method.

It seemed like a good enough idea, 

I'm on my way back now to clean up the glass. 
</p>

my detriment 

I wish I'd figured this out earlier. Imagine all that I could have accomplished... 

<p>
photo of clouds<br> 

upset that her photo of clouds had to find some sense of solace. 
<br>
It seemed clear to her that they all believed that the photo was unique and breathtaking <br>despite their lack of public enthusiasm 

they all tried to console her in saying that the photo's popularity was trivial if it represented something more deeply meaningful to her on a personal level... if it was in fact an authentic reflection of her and a true expression of her inner being then what did its popularity matter at the end of the day?
<br>
The identical nature of their response seemed peculiar <br>

she began to feel an overwhelming sense that they may be, in fact, conspiring against her. 

In trying to repress her doubt Linda began to view her friends as cruelly and idiotically stunted in their mental capacities. 


Linda, her egregiously narcissistic tendencies had gotten the best of her... 
<br>
...but if you saw the photo that Linda took you would agree that it was terrible. 
<br>she was delusional in her ability to capture the beauty she claimed. 

you would think that I would find a way to tell her that her photography skills are nothing short of abysmal but the truth is I just don't have the heart. 

I'm unsure how to continue with this client. I do sincerely enjoy our Wednesday afternoon chats and she does seem perfectly comfortable in paying my rate indefinitely but...  I think she would find peace if someone just worked up the courage to tell her the truth about her cloud photo.   

In the meantime, as I figure this out, I've decided to start her on trial dose of C. I haven't had much success prescribing it in the past but hopefully third time's a charm. Fingers crossed.

there are so many great shows on all the time. 

but I know I will become too tired to stay awake that late at night. 
<br>
Last night I was up between 3:30 and 6:30 so today I am very tired, but with a few cups of coffee I am doing alright. 
</p>


<p>
I was considering writing a story about a bar of soap 
The other characters in the movie would be an empty water bottle that had been run over by a car and was in the gutter.
</p>
<p>The tuna salad has been selling extremely well this week, a lot more than usual and I have no idea why.
I'll be honest, I've been daydreaming a lot about what I'm going to do with the extra cash.
<br>
I am thinking of buying a gift  and decided I would try to find a good plant. 
<br>
There was one store I knew of that wasn't too far away. I looked through the window and it seemed to have many different types that were decently priced, but unfortunately they were closed <br>

I knew there was another shop a couple blocks away. I was lucky to get the time to walk 
<br>
The second plant store was expensive. I wasn't even feeling that cheap, I just thought everything was over priced so I took off. 
<br>
And then the third shop, was on the way back to my house. 

I found a small plant outside. It was the only one left <br>

They charged .50 cents extra for debit <br> And  they charged 1.00 extra to use credit. They were lucky I didn't walk out after seeing that. 

</p>
<p>
I ended up making a decent wage today<br>
carrying tables, pylons
and listening closely to the radio, finding out what needs to be done. 

I will look forward to waking up tomorrow, 
with a clear mind, 
to return to work on my stories again.

And in a month or so, when my cheque comes 
in the mail 
I will cash it immediately. 
</p>


I am afflicted sometimes 
by a certain mood, that by way of subtle indirect tension, inflicts a sort of spiritual paralysis.
<br>
Suddenly the future becomes futile, bleak<br>
the present intolerable 
and the past frames itself as a vague history of failed attempts to avoid the inevitable. 

Forced optimism as a strategy to mitigate, seems like the obvious fix 
but unfortunately only grinds against the stone
strengthening its hold and prolonging its symptoms.
<br>
Instead sometimes it can be best to succumb to it.

Find a way to let it be <br>
so it can dissipate. <br>
it may be that the antidote to the condition is to acknowledge and accept it. 
<br>
As I come up for air now, and my ability to string words together returns, 
I hope that taking these notes will allow me to better recognize it in the future.
So that when this happens again, the cortisol will remain at bay. 

And in the meantime 
I will continue to write, as a means of plunging through the belly of the beast. 
</p>
<p>

a note to plant owners 

Someone left a leaf
inside of a jar 
by the window

and it has now grown exponentially.

So much so
that it has destroyed 

the jar

and the room

and the house 

and the country 

and the earth 

and the sun 

and the moon 

and the universe.

And now everything is lettuce. 

Please, for next time -- take good care of your plants
but not to the extent that they incite the demise of all conceivable matter and beyond.

Drinking chocolate milk 
for the first time in years... 

I have returned to when I was just tall enough to reach the refrigerator door 
as a young man.

I would push a chair across the kitchen,
ascend to the top shelf, and carry the carton down. 

I was fearless then.

With sheer willpower alone I could lift trucks from the sidewalk,
create masterpieces, and land on my feet. 

But one day something happens

and we needed someone to take responsibility 
for our failures...

it takes a minute, or two, to realize that the biggest failure of all 
is to neglect that the responsibility is ours alone. 

There is a wormhole there, in the sole proprietorship of failure
that allows us to get back to the place 

where sheer willpower alone can lift trucks from the sidewalk,
create masterpieces, and land on our feet. 

So what would I tell that young man now,
if I had the chance?

Push the chair across the kitchen and 
always reach for the chocolate milk.
</p>
<p>

Sometimes I get nothing done,

I sit here with a grey mind and no idea what I'm doing. 


Processing words
<br> a joyless hellhole,

I would rather eat a fire extinguisher.


I will try again tomorrow,<br>

It has been one year and a half or more <br>

I have the impulse to clutter up the space here with more words
but I will try to refrain from doing so. 
<br>
I've already said what I don't remember
<p>
There was a coupon <br>a really good deal <br>
so we put in an order for takeout.
I don't remember what we talked about on the way to pick it up, it was probably nothing in particular. 

We were so hungry on the way home that we had to stop and eat on a bench.
There were pigeons jumping around trying to get a piece of noodle. 
I don't remember what we talked about then, it was probably nothing in particular. 

On the way home 
I remember what we talked about We were thinking of getting a cat. 

</p>
<p>
our new cat <br>
he is a little black cat <br>
his name is mouse 
<br>
he took a nap on a shoebox under the bed
<br>
he slept on my pillow above my head
<br>
he likes to eat my hand
<br>
he is the best friend I have ever had

</p>


I took a shortcut through the field on my way home. <br>
I noticed a cloud in the middle of the grass. <br>

I tore off a piece 
I jumped onto it. It floated upward. 
I jumped off of it and it sunk back into the grass. 
  
Over here, I said and guided a tow truck into the field.

I don't think I'm supposed to drive on the grass here, the tow truck driver said. 

That's alright, I said. I think this cloud must have fallen down

I'll hitch it. the tow truck driver said.

Alright.

he lowered the lift onto the cloud and the cloud began to float upward into the sky.

The tow truck was hooked on the cloud and also started to lift into the sky. 

The tow truck driver screamed.
<br>
Should I jump? The tow truck driver asked. 

no it's too long a long fall, I shouted back.

Come, again? he screamed. 

he was very high up in the sky at this point, almost out of sight.

sitting in the sun and eating rice 

Today I am quite tired from sitting in the sun and eating rice

My girlfriend found a good book in a box outside of someone's house when she was out 

She brought it home and gave it to me as a present. 

I put it up on the wall by my desk and am happy to have it there.

It is important to find the things that you love to do 

and meet people while doing those things. 

Because there is a good chance 

that the people you meet while doing those things 

will be the ones that you love.

I was up very early in the morning 
<br>
thinking

Things have been peaceful lately.

I am grateful for all of this.

I have been riding my bike through the city over potholes. 
Sometimes I go faster than cars going at 100 mph. 
<br>

At this speed  
The possibility of crashing is never out of the question. 

<br>

It would be nice to drink some water and read

But I bet if I tried right now 
I would only get a few pages in before the book would fall onto the ground 
because I would have fallen asleep while reading it. 

And then I would be woken up by the same book
that put me to sleep

you would agree.

I am considering the demon of the shrill rabbit hole

There was a more detailed thought 
at some point<br>
but on the other hand
no one can attest to what was mentioned <br>
then or in any other instance -- so 
what I will say 
is that knowing you're mistaken <br>
is a surefire way to muster the courage to sacrifice being right.

But alas, these are but mere utterances that the fang protruded from the highway to the grass and the dirt.

Sometimes when I get too secluded, I begin to rot. As difficult as it can be to unrot, or re-ripen, it is possible.

How can the hog cross the dirt road <br>

What blessing can be said

and passes the dismal inept trucks 
on his way before 

<p>

I recommend 
that you watch tv  

and eat potato chips 

with your cat and your girlfriend 

and read a book 

and then sleep in  

If that isn't enough, then nothing will be. 
It is the pinnacle 
It is the thrill of it all. 

this pillowcase was likely sent to me in error
I have decided to send it back to the return address --
<p>
A, 
Thank you for your response. Yes, it may be true 
that the only opinion I actually believe in, is my own, and yes it is easy to rebuttal and to defy if the opinion in question isn't aligned with what I want to believe already. 
<br>
I suspect that most people are like this in order to maintain some sense of self that can function in the world, but depending how wrong I am, this could show a huge deficit in my ability to present as a socialized person. 
<br>
Alternatively I can think of a half dozen or so times where my sense of my own opinion and self has become so unhinged that I have lost a great deal, especially in my personal finances... this may be the opposite extreme, and result in the stubbornness you've pointed out, the one I cling to, for safety. 
<br>
I do not aspire to project an overbearing or egregious sense of self as you mentioned, or that I have attempted to describe above. I hope you know I do value a sense of confidence and stability. 
<br>
It is in fact of my opinion that perhaps there is growth that stems from the discourse of these forces and the only real danger is leaning too far into one end or another.
<br>
I will ask that you do advise though. 
<br>
Regards, 
<br>

I couldn't help but notice the audience's criticism <br>
I overheard a woman in a lawn chair say that if only she had known it would have been this bad...<br>  

I cannot deny that I felt sad but on the other hand, I did think it may be for the best -- how would he ever learn without facing such adversity?
<br>
Ruminating on the subject, I came to realize that perhaps that was optimistic. and only a way for me to curb how ashamed I felt for him and inadvertently myself.  
<br>
Perhaps it would be better for him to give up and admit that no matter how hard he practiced or how much adversity he overcame, there was no way for him to win over an audience of that scale. 
<br>
At the end of the day, his ambition and persistence could amount to nothing more than a curse because -- he just isn't very good.
</p>

<p>
Upon listening to the radio this morning I was pleasantly surprised to hear him participating in a live on air interview. 
<br>
I was impressed by his humility as he recollected a conversation he'd had with his daughter, 
<br>
when she confessed that despite the daily embarrassment she felt for him, she admired him deeply, for giving her courage to pursue the things in her life that she would be most ashamed to fail at.  
</p>
<p>
It’s getting colder but 

To be honest 
I don’t know its been pretty quiet there lately on account of everything. 

Perhaps its time to let it go 
</p>
<p>
an attempted eulogy I<br>

This morning I became nostalgic for some writing 
I'd done in the past. 

I spent some time revisiting the work this afternoon.
It had some good aesthetic qualities, but inevitably I would say it was too abstract and melodramatic.

I considered what it would be like if I'd written it now
and the truth is, I would probably throw it out and write something else. 

Maybe I would delete it and write exactly this.
But I must admit that still somehow, after all of these years, I can't seem to let it go entirely. 

The truth is there was a sincerity and a perfection to that writing that I don't know if I will ever beat.
And for that I must respect it, for outliving the rest and refusing to die.
<br>
an attempted eulogy II 
<br>
I became attached to the idea 
of saying nothing 

and I came close 
enough in doing so 

to realize
that the only way to say nothing is to not say anything at all.

It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge 
the ways in which I attempted to fill the space
the vacuum, the absurdity, the effort.

Perhaps I'd tricked myself into thinking that saying nothing, with the conviction of being,
had value or meaning. 

Perhaps succeeding at saying nothing is only a failure in saying something,
and I will criticize it,
as foolish, cowardly,
aesthetically rich 
and transcendently bankrupt.
<br>
an attempted eulogy III
<br>
a single bolt of lighting struck a bowl of soup
and eviscerated the noodles 

the customers shared the broth and despite learning it was a rerun 
continued watching the football match on television

there was a plank of wood leaning against a wall in a basement which no one knew about
it has been melodramatic to say the least 

elsewhere a seagull flies around 
considering a way to exorcise its neurosis 

but is unwilling to defy the wisdom of its upbringing 
having being raised by the ghost of a raccoon 
<br>
an attempted eulogy IV

Somehow it seemed like the failure to be understood was a mark of uniqueness and originality and that the eternal tabula rasa'ing was a sign of fearlessness, but the truth was that the vhs tapes with the hours and hours of pointless blurry seagull and cloud footage, amounted to nothing more than a vague etherial sentiment to the person who recorded it.

Passing through the dirt, churning raw milk,<br>

I am proud to admit that I finished reading my library book today.

It was very long –– five hundred and thirty eight pages. 

I wonder what it would be like to write a book that is over five hundred pages. 

Maybe one day I will give it a shot. But for now, these sentences will have to do.

</p>
<p>

I already have my next book checked out from the library.

It’s just over two hundred pages. I’m looking forward to reading it.

</p>

<p>

I am looking forward to resting my head this evening 
and watching a bit of tv
with my girlfriend 
and my cat. 
</p>
<p>
I am unconcerned with any other reward
for the foreseeable future.Tomorrow morning I will read my book on the couch while my cat runs circles around the room
<br>
Earlier this morning I was reading a book on the couch while my cat ran circles around the room.
There were sentences I glazed over, that I may never return to. 
<br>
When I was in the shower, as my coffee was brewing,  
I dog eared a thought because it seemed like I had something to say about it, but now that I am here, I'm unsure what it was exactly.
<br>
Perhaps it had something to do with the memory I have –– imagining it for the first time.
When the dust went on the ground 
and a lot of people realized 
they needed the pizza box 
to use as a dustpan. 

This would be the pizza box 
stacked 
in the hallway.

Some people thought that the dust was from etherial dead skin,
others thought the wind had blown it in off a hacksaw somewhere 
and others thought it was only created by time. 
<br>
You can say what you will about what you think is right
but I'll always side with the snail crates
<br>
and I understand how offended you are but frankly I still believe you’re dead wrong.
<br>
Yes, perhaps I could have phrased my message in a more cordial manner but who even cares at this point? 
<br>
You knew full well that the truck was packed to the brim with those snail crates and you still insisted on bringing your dog
<br>
What did you think would happen?
<br>
the black foot truck stop 
<p>
Most people liked going to that restaurant for their 24 hour breakfast.

nostalgia 

A calculator 
was ditched in the snow 
on the side of the road. 

The battery was long dead 
but there was a small solar panel 
built into the top of it. 

Each day the sun melted the snow, bit by bit, until finally 
one morning, the calculator turned on. 
Every night the calculator would die, and every morning it was revived. because of the solar panel on it.

 –– a man, wearing a ski jacket,  
was on his way 
and noticed the calculator on the side of the road. 
he picked the calculator off of the ground 
and put it into his pocket.

The server brought a window. 
He looked longingly through the parking lot, past the road –– 

and vaguely transfixed by something past the melting snow and the passing trucks,
he had lost himself somewhere in recollection of the moment he'd first found 
There was mildew  
in the ceiling 
<br>
A fellow pointed it out 
The waitress  
and brought a ladder, a spray bottle, a sponge and rubber gloves from the back. 

She climbed up the ladder and started scrubbing. 
He kept telling her where to step and how to go about it. 

She lost her temper twice before he finally went for it. 
He got down on his knee and offered her the diamond ring that he'd bought her. 

The mildew had been there so long, 
it was truly a wonder she hadn't noticed it before.
</p>

<p>

The booths have been reupholstered twice in the past seven years.  

It was an odd choice the second time around. 

The fabric has a print of that shows a pattern of Highway 61 graphics –– which is nowhere close to where they're located. 


I saw a bunch of magpies puttering out on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant last time I was there. 

On his way out, on accident, A whacked one of them with the front door and knocked it halfway to the gas pump.

A lot of stories went around after that. About what A didn't or didn't do. 
 
sitting with a glass of tap water 
waiting for the ice to melt,
I am trying to concentrate on my thoughts 

The ceiling 
as an ornament 
cannot transcend itself 
in this very moment 
but if there was a cavity in it, 
due to a defect 
in its design
or something ...  
I would be interested in what that might be like </p>
<p>
I spoke on the phone

To wj
Who assured me


That they would arrive in time.
There is nothing else I can do
Or perhaps more specifically, I should say there is nothing else I am willing to do.

At the moment everyone is going to have to either A) wait until tomorrow or B) do their job for a living 

This happens so often I can't say I'm surprised. 

find a way to solve the problem with what we have <br>
I'm sorry you now know I'm willing to lie to you in order to get the job done but I want to get home in time for dinner
<br>

What is any of this worth if not for that?

the sky splashes the water
off the hillside and wades in the water. 
looking on going farther down. 
Past the sky out the window of the cloud's helm.
There are many clouds in the sky, but one in particular separates from the bunch and plummets downward towards it into the mud. 
<br>

out for dinner  
he asked what was behind my anger. 

I responded, what anger?
because I did not feel angry. 

I began to feet embarrassed that he thought I was angry 
and then I began to feel angry, that he thought I angry.

He's not dead, but we're out of touch. 
I may never even see him again. 
But I suppose it 
is always prevalent.

sparks burst from a power line and good coleslaw passes it over.

if you happen to see any termites wearing any blue or pink friendship bracelets in the next few days…not last week
but then, two nights ago 
<p>
succumbing to failure 
<br>to admit –– 
the utility of the act is nothing short of an embarrassment
to neglect is its own torture 
and the complacency is rot so –– we are here
</p>
<p>
a good sum of cash and sentiment 
a notion out there that 
it's ok –– because you did it for yourself 
disingenuously sentimental
it is for ourselves and our money 
in part, it has the most money 
in part, the ability to work hard must be the reward in itself
fortune, ownership 
It is obvious that by no means am I thinking 
of the glow of the coil.
to get through everything right now, but I guess at the end of the day he probably just needs the cash.

a clock by sheer coincidence 
as a minute. Everyone thinks I am so slow  
to continue his sentence 
for what seemed like an eternity –– 
but was in fact only sixty seconds...
How can anyone be expected to understand your worth if you cannot even see it yourself
And with that the sauce simmered away into the depths of the pan

the holy sabbath 

two guys trying to jam the truck door back into the battery truck on the side of the highway exit 
<br>
a llama eats a roll of carpet from the carpet factory dumpster 
<br>
triplet jam jars roll down the snow, on the hillside 
<br>
I wish to take credit for all of it 
my involvement was limited 
</p>

to the money tree, <br>

thank you for being there –– 
for those years ... 

when it was just me in my old apartment 
it meant something to see you bend towards the sun 


I will await the day our paths cross again 
and in the meantime, I will say thank you 
for your resilience  
and for being there 
</p>
<p>

in a tall box 
...behold the big sky
and the clouds 
... off on some southern prairie trail 
out of nowhere –– a herd of bighorn sheep 
leaving nothing but a cloud of dust 
over the rocks, through the dirt over the hill 
until –– for seemingly no reason at all 
the dog stopped

for no good reason
he just stopped –– they got back in the car and went home and that was that 

but I'm telling you,  ––  it happened and they seemed grateful enough, all things considered 
</p>
<p>


I was walking down the street 
across from the church... 

it was weird, <br>I saw a guitar amp tipped over, in the middle of the road 
<br>
and I don't know why I did this exactly 
but I went into the street and stood under its shadow
<br>
all the cars kept speeding by, most of them not even swerving out of the way 
I thought about going into the church and asking if it was theirs... 
but instead, I went to the pawn shop and dumped it onto the counter
the guy there looked at it and 
he took note of the damage. I told him it just got like that from all the years of good use

and then he said –– he could give me twenty bucks for it, but he was pretty sure this is the same model that my church uses and I heard they were missing their amp,</p>
<p> so how about this, he said, I'll give you forty bucks to go return it to them for me...
<br>
I took the forty bucks and walked a few blocks
but then my arms got tired so I tossed it off the side of a bridge and watched it smash on the road 
<br>
on my way back I started feeling guilty 
that guy gave me forty bucks and I didn't come through for him 
but then again what were they doing leaving their amp in the middle of the road?

so I went all the way down to bottom of the bridge 
and just as I thought 
the amp was totally smashed to bits
I went to go get the pieces that were salvageable but then a massive truck came and it smashed the those bits down to even smaller bits 
<br>
still, I did what I could and I collected the pieces 
and I brought them all back to the church 
<br>
they seemed grateful enough, all things considered 

the guilt has been lingering a bit, <br>
but if I'm being honest, I think I did the right thing in the end 

</p>
<p>

a bag of soil was thrown off the balcony 
and hit the wheelbarrow –– 

the soil went everywhere 
all over the snow 
maybe like an oreo cookie 

and now the wheelbarrow is gone 
ask anyone –– no ones seen it 

it would have made a good stool to get up to the electrical box 
when the breakers flip

there was so much crap in the way before
the air conditioner exhaust tube... 
we cleaned it all up –– and now –– especially as I have never seen the way in which an axe would split through cactus 
and how lightning strikes upwards but  

admittedly, it was my fault 
for so blatantly expressing my distaste with the way the money was handled 
<br>
originally my plan was to stay in my office 
with the radiator 
and my computer
and my lawn chair 
and cheese cloth,
and grass, <br>
and electricity 
and dirt 
and eels
and worms 
<br>
there is snow on the ground now 
and 
we don't know where the worms sleep 
if they all die and reincarnate in the spring 
<br>
or become spaghetti 
<br>
and die in spaghetti boxes
</p>

<p>
the button on the top of the window 
that makes all of the files organize themselves by name 
or date created, or size 
–– I am trying to figure out how to do that for papers in real life 
<br>
eternal damnation, life insurance 
<br>now that there is snow on the ground 
some of the tents have been catching fire 

my cousin's house caught fire yesterday as well 
he is a realtor –– the irony is meaningless as far as I can tell 

my cousin's house and the tents have little to do with one another 
even though they have both burned to ash 
and my brain has melted into flamingo meat 
</p>
<p>
I will recommend cremating it and using the remnants as fireworks <br>

tumbleweed blows between two sneering fireworks
and a waterfall recycles itself through a pacman exit </p>
<p>
sense the new multitudes of fear, that my library books overdue

<br>I had been frivolously writing something 
when I found out that you had died </p>
<p>

maybe the clouds would divide heaven from the sky
if heaven as a layer of the sky was something to believe 

I know how hard it was for you, while you were here 
I remember your bravery 
and the door you held open for me

perhaps it is time 
to forget humility
and take the digger to the graveyard 
proverbially speaking, of course 
and despite their ongoing interpersonal problems 
and their inability to reconcile their grievances 
they will still have some people that will be there for them  
— and in the end they will get the money 
<br>
This ending will please many people 
as what more can anyone ask for 
than the right to an opinion 
a couple of friends 
and a bag of money.

<p>
the exhaustion was impossible to transpire <br>
they arrived on the counter top inexplicably <br>
I realized my spinal chord was missing <br>
I could see it there on the coffee table, 
it did not look damaged or broken
</p>

<p>
he forgot or something <br>
I got distracted and saw a car battery on the side of the road  
<br> in the end the coils were too crusted over with acid 
it was worthless 

I got distracted on purpose 
</p>
<p>
crumpled next to the blue plastic water bottle
–– that sits on the edge of the table 
remiss to note that the direction of the sun 
remains irrelevant as ever 
in the way the light bends through the window 
sentimental, critical, 
the nerve I have to then worry
and worse –– to take offence 
to think poorly of them 
for thinking poorly of me

the crab shell washes up on the shore

I will float this glass across the room until it vanishes <br>
formidable dust 
blows off the dust 
and sends it onto the ground 
–– I do not know where the dust ends up 
when it hits the ground 

</p>
<p>
on the way home I stopped at a shed 
and ordered two rice pouches 

they came in a paper bag 
and were still warm by the time I got home 

Mouse jumped up on the kitchen table 
and Miriam took a break from her work so we could eat them together 

on my deathbed I will remember that little table 
and how it was good to be home 
</p>
<p>
the void 
–– with a knife in it 
that has a pink color and snow on its leavesI looked inside the pocket of my old jacket and found an old crumpled tissue 
from eleven winters ago
the crusted snot –– it is all good man
<br>
I may have been at the hockey game 
sitting and
eating fries with my dad. 
<br>
or looking out the window of a bus 
</p>
<p>
I will look forward to a hot cup of coffee 
a  minnow in the cup 
I tried to catch it 

Mouse pawed at it
and caught it and ate it

beside the east facing conveyor belt  
<br>
I have remembered something–– 
inside the warehouse 
there is a nail 
standing upright 
beside the east facing conveyor belt <br> 
you have to look closely to find it 
but it's there

the warehouse has no insulation 
but its still warmer than the outside 
so at night there a lot of deer sleeping on the conveyer belts 
<p>
this morning –– 
I was lucky to find an old heater 
from the basement 
I put it beside my desk 

it kept me warm throughout the day 
as I completed my work 
</p>
<p>
I did not build the dam 
–– I'm not sure where I'll get my water from</p>


my cat ripped up a whole paper bag from the library yesterday  

he loves eating cans of fish 
and looking out the window 
and messing with his toys 

he loves wrestling 
and climbing 
and cuddling up on a blanket 

every time he wakes up from a nap 
I am excited to hang out with him 
he is the best  
</p>
<p>I must admit my computer 
moments
<br>I would be a fool <br>

</p>
<p>
outside the vet
I saw a man crying in his truck <br>
I cannot blame him for breaking down <br>

few things are as sacred <br>
few human relationships can compare <br>

still we got Mouse neutred <br> 
it is so fucking sad to do that<br>

He came home ravenous 
he tore through his food and both the cones we had for him 
he destroyed the room 
we called the emergency vet 
they did not know what to do 
<br>
none of the meds could calm him down 
we barely slept 
he fought to hell for his freedom 
and eventually he won, rendering us utterly hopeless
<br>

after assuring our defeat –– he finally slept, and it has been almost twelve hours 
he comes up for the occasional pet 
or a snack or a sip of water 
...I've never seen anyone so exhausted 
he is resting now 
but slowly starting to act like his old self 

</p>
<p>

I am not so sure I can tell you what I know 
in my desk drawer
the pigeon, a pigeon went into the department 
as a sole proprietor 
and knocked over a box 
it was strange 
when it
flapped into the lights 

–– the fluorescent glass 
all over the receipt books 
and nobody knew until days later –– <br>
it is okay not to consider the things that have happened 
when the fireplace has melted itself 
and the union fees have been paid by an anonymous donor 
and there is a lot of snow on the ground

</p>
<p>

I was able to read just over two hundred pages this weekend 
and I hope to finish the chapter I'm on tonight
</p>

the spider 
climbs the walls of the jar 
<p>
I will look forward to drinking my water and finishing these books
<br>
I remember the staircase that led up to the restroom 
<br>
the dandruff that would be on the front of my shirt 
<br>
I still have two books out from the library that I haven’t finished 
I am determined to finish them before they have to go back on monday 
</p>
<p>
few people will believe what happened here today... 
it is something even bigger than you can imagine 
<br>
trying to leak the toilet 
I lifted a portion of it 
before my cat jumped onto the edge of it 

<br>

<p>
the shadow of a tree and the tree 

and a new computer 
at the bottom 
</p>
<p>
I have brought it into my office 
I am quite scared, 
I will type in the password

</p>
<p>
I didn't feel great 
in a way <br>
it was looking like I'd wasted the last few months <br>

but today, 
I have brought a new computer into my office 
</p>
<p>

I am sitting here looking at this <br>
wondering what the hell went wrong<br>
from the ceiling 
a can opener incision
sparked onto the carpet 
<br>
these are things a lot of people know 
but not many choose 
to accept 
for instance 
tomorrow morning 
I will read a chapter of my book 
the more I think about it the more –– I would recommend it to anyone 
and I wonder what they would say 
the occasional message from a friend 
I'm not sure there is much else to it </p>
<p>
there are two library books that I didn't read in time 
before they had to go back 
I feel guilty 
and that I have failed 
but I suppose one day  
I can get those book again 
and have a second chance
</p>

<p>

good 
measuring tape 
has become a femur bone 
and the spritzer bottle 
plywood falls into the mud 
and splashes a puddle 
and icicles pour from the sinksthe lampshade, the urinal dust 

if they kick it across the room I don't know if it will land back on the lamppost 
dust floats through the air 
and by a cat 
...when he opens his palm 
he is surprised to find nothing 

perhaps it wasn't the dust
it was just the shadow of the dust 

garbage day comes...
the static comes in from a satellite dish...

</p>
<p>

cardboard <br>
I need exhaustion 
having finished 
the shrew wisdom <br>

where the wisdom serves no one
it is just 
in the glue 
in slippers and robe 
the power outage 
was blamed on a twig on the ground 
combined with a thermostat 

...ask the guard 
he will tell you whose fault it was 

a very high up cloud <br>
— the final depth of hell 

a few days later... the seagull returned
and became a demon worse than satan 
</p>
<p>
and now it lives in the dumpster of the restaurant 
there is no remorse for the wrath that awaits 
</p>


the park has a lot of dirt on the ground
and some of the dirt around the snow has become mud 
from all of the melting <br>
I will find myself wearing sunglasses
<br>
sad to see them 
hidden under the rug 
<br>
I tried them out
but my face had become strange
and for a moment –– I forgot who I was 
<br>
after that moment... it has slowly been coming back to me 
...but I can't quite grasp it... 

...one thing I know for sure... is that things will never be the same again
I can't go back to the person I was 
<br>
I had to make sure all of my e-mails have been checked 
<br>but a massive gust of wind came from the window...
<br>
I will mention as well... last night I dreamt that I was staring at a photocopier light...
and this morning when I was brushing my teeth I noticed one of my molars was gone... 
I've realized that maybe it's best to keep the windows closed when it is so windy <br>
and at the best of times
I would have no idea what to say to you <br>
I have accepted ten thousand dollars <br>

many people have wondered the status 
many people have demanded to know what is going on...

but on second thought... I have decided to say nothing 
in this case... it is better to speak into a walkie talkie on a channel no one is listening to 

it is for the best 

thank you for the rv 
it was terrible
the this woman it
drove it against a pole four times 
<br>
I did everything I had to do 
to get it out of my sight </p>
<p>
a small feather
was on the screw driver 
that was used to take the deadbolt off the door 
<br>
it was rusted shut 
and nobody could open it 
until they put a small feather on the screw driver 

I'm not sure who figured it out 
I know this one guy is trying to take the credit
but everyone knows it wasn't him 
and that he is a facetious liar
<br>
I have no problem saying that he was a facetious liar 
even publicly 
because the guy is out of control
<br>
the truth is I hope one day to reconcile with him
because it's not good to have another enemy out there
so maybe when I see him again 
I'll ask him how it's been going lately 
</p>
<p>
the wax, the soil, the mud

the continuation of when the wax has become burned to the bottom of the beehive

the continuation of the flower pot 
when the soil has spilled onto the ground
and the worms have become ouroboros 

the continuation of the nile 
when the mud has dried to toothpaste

I am trying to come home 
but it has been difficult 
–– everyone has an opinion 

</p>

<p>

I will have a sip of water and relax 
<br>

it has come time 
to look at the books 
<br>
I have many cheques to write tomorrow 
probably one hundred 
<br>
great
<br>
I am exhausted
<br>
but I have my ten thousand dollars 
and now I will go back to my writing
</p>
<p>

I continue to wake up thinking of trucks 
and scaffolding 
falling onto the road 
<br>
the sky and a cloud 
...eventually another cloud 
<br>
it must be learned the hard way
and many people must witness the failure  
if it is to be worth the while to gowhere no trucks return and no trucks belong

</p>
<p>
a stick on the sidewalk
has a leaf coming out of it 
<br>
it is strange be home 
when a bag of soil has spilled all over the road 
<br>
I am wondering what will happen to that stick 
if it will drop onto someone's head –– as a prank 
<br>
perhaps tomorrow I will go to find that stick again
and perhaps tomorrow I will forget it even exists
<br>
too close to understanding 
most often –– it is impossible to understand why people do the things they do 
<br>
my attempt to find a reason 
has proven frivolous so far
<br>

it is difficult to admit that I currently don’t care
<br>

tomorrow I will see how it goes 
<br>
but now it has come time to look inside the garbage can 
<br>
and remove this shoebox full of twenty dollar bills
<br>

afterward I will get a cup 
and fill it with water
and I will drink the water  
and then I will wash the cup 

and leave it to dry 
before putting it back in the cupboard 
</p>
<p>


each day when I return to the keyboard to grapple with the page –– 
it is strange to realize how difficult it is to progress, reasonably 

the discomfort is unparalleled 
despite my weariness, I have learned to trust it, for the most part.

</p>

<p>

I would like to spend some time thinking about my supper 
a hamburger and fries — it was great
and I was happy to watch tv while I ate it

I also gave my cat a can of supper as well 
he ate it and licked his paws 
and now he is taking a quick nap 

it is peaceful for the moment.
but I know he will be up again soon and when he wakes up 
he will be ready to wreak havoc again

</p>

a racoon walks across the stoop 
the moon goes through a cloud

the dust releases from the ground 
and sprinkles back into the sky 

the racoon retreats across the stoop 
the moon fades behind the cloud 
a cobweb has been lingering between the radiator for a long time.
and I am concerned 

perhaps I have stripped the bolt 
in trying too hard to loosen it 

I am weary to fall into self pity and to admit failure 

</p>

I was wrong about the doormat, folded in the dumpster 
and that is fine 
because I intend to keep our doormat 
it has been through a lot
and I think it could last for many more years 

–– the doormat has not been folded
it was just a reflection from the glass on the door 

it is possible to be wrong 
and it is possible to be wrong, often 

being with people is necessary, but not always easy to manage 
and for the most part I feel like I have it anchored 

but I am wrong sometimes, 
and sometimes I am wrong often

perhaps the doormat has been folded...
but there is no room in the dumpster for it 
and that is fine 
because I want to keep our doormat 
it has been through a lot
and I think it could last for many more years

I have enjoyed playing chess online 
with my buddy from back home
<br>
we can play many simultaneous games 
the computer can generate infinite chess boards 
<br>
I have played a few strangers on the site 
and it's kind of fun -- but not as good as playing a friend <br>
it helps to play chess 
and lose, and know that it's no ones fault but your own 
<br>
it's humbling to say the least 
<br>
my Dad taught me how to play when I was a kid

a stack of papers I will read over tomorrow 

we used to record the episodes off the tv and watch them again and again 

and now here I am, a little bit older

I am glad everyone is okay 
for the moment 
it is difficult to remember how temporary it is 
it can be hard to concentrate 
</p>
<p>
the concern 
that I must address
is regarding
the library and the bookstore 

at the moment, I will be honest –– there are no books I am too excited about reading
which is preposterous
but true 
unfortunately <br>
it can be hard to concentrate 
on a book
even though I would love to take some time 
to read <br>
there is a part where she writes a recipe for a grilled cheese sandwhich and eats a grilled cheese sandwich 
and the police are at her house
that I was happy to read
</p>
<p>
I have carried a massive irritation <br>
I'm not sure I'm as concerned with it as I should be 
but perhaps I can put my finger on it 

sometimes 
the little bastard catches fire 
too much too fast –– 
<br>blaming the fire 

I once saw a guy, starving –– he blew out the flame 
and here was a backdraft and he burnt his mouth 
<br>
patiently to the core
<br>
–– carry the massive irritation 
<br>
–– be concerned

for thirteen and a half hours

I tried not to be impatient 
I read half a book
considering yesterday's bastardization of the pylon honour

<p>
considering yesterday's bastardization 
of the pylon honour... 
<br>
perhaps I was angry 

but as a pylon... 
I could manage to turn pages

reviewing the clarity 

pylons over concrete 
seldom figment 
</p>
<p>

I had at one point thought it would be a good idea
overwhelmed by my love 
as I reflect back now on my impulse to write  
I cannot help but feel slightly hollow
merely a figment in this context

...sometimes the knife is not sharp enough to cut through 

the day <br>
every day 

sometimes

I suppose that is the high
I am after

not an escape 
but the time when the eyes must be ghoulish

I am only trying to carve a simple skull 

but 

in the end 

the eyes must be damning 

–– but I will sharpen my sheath, I will try again

I was in the car with my Dad <br>
I felt that things weren't going too well for me <br>
he told me to be persistent & patient <br>

It wasn't much more than a mutter on his behalf
but I've tried to stick with it <br>

refining–– tuning 
aiming towards the core 

<p>
catching the fly, only to set it free
...will see how it goes

I've quit and sold my desk, 
and my chair and my keyboard 
for a mule

we've been standing outside the costco 
for work 
<br>
for the most part 
we're dragging flats of soda and hummus and things like that
across town 
to people's homes 

some people buy too much to fit in their cars 
so we're 
hauling the overflow
<br>
business has been improving 
and I'm making more money than I was writing 

we're usually pretty tired when we get home 
I dump a bucket of water on the mule's head
to cool him down

we sit and watch the sunset 
eating carrots
and trying to get some rest 
before the next day begins

small 
towards no guarantee outcome
with no guarantee of returning 
unless in his grave 
perhaps severed or 
pierced by the fang 

it was an act 
that was true,
inarguably so 

a fool raged in the hellish sun 
though the lightning 
and upon saving his family 
he was considered a hero 
undoubtably so 
here lies the demon we defeated
the yard hallowed , sleeping at the foot of the bed

</p>

<p>

the water from the faucet 
pours into the sink 
annd back to the bell tower
looking upward 
the falcon that was there 
and we looked at the falcon 
and someone said that it lived in the church across the street 
in the bell tower 
with another falcon 
and someone told their child not to go closer 
since the child was no larger than the falcon 
and as the falcon stood on the branch 
a baby bird called out from its nest, for help 
and the falcon took the baby bird 
and dropped it down, from its nest to the dirt 
and all of the people gasped
and the baby bird was dead 
and we marvelled at the falcon’s wingspan 
when it flew off 
and went back to the bell tower

I carved out the tape 
in dust, 
I have been walking in
dirtand  grass 

I am my slippers 
all things considered

a great feeling 
and not expensive, 

I should be home 
</p>

<p>
the noticed light 
dialling in from the lid 

it is thoughtful and of a cloud passing the sky
<br>
and to rebar and the giant tongue 

I present to you both
water <br>

thank you 

</p>


away from the river

trying to take me around some dirt

I hopped off 
and fell into the dirt

we came to the river 
and we stood there and looked at it 

the water rushing 
over the rocks

the clouds across the river 

we walked further 

I stood and considered offering my arm 
I was just going to eat the guy's head

I tossed the till into a ditch maybe along the way 
we continued on  
a flashing light 
reflecting off the horse's eye

coming from the road
the cop shot me  
and I became tangled in the rein
being dragged along the river rocks 

<br>
I drank the water from the river
I was thirsty for a long time 


and the dust settled –– after we crossed the river 
</p>

<p>
lying in the dirt 
out of the grass 
to the store to buy a new shirt and jeans and a hat 

his family always said they hated him 
and his friends said that too

and so you can know his redemption is true and he is a good man 
it doesn’t seem like I will get to enjoy my cup of coffee in the meantime
while I sit and read my book <br>a page 
about people 

if the things that happened to them 
made them who they are 

if it was the way they were born 


perhaps who they are 
meant something 
</p>
<p>

grass is so strange 
I don’t even know the point of it

it is nice to rip from the ground
every once in a while 

 it is good 
for the land 

the cloud came from the sky and lowered into the field 

the sun was a circle of yellow 
and the cloud left the field and went back into the sky

the grass will not move 

we will wait, 
to see  
</p>
<p> 
concerned that the leaf was stupid 

and its shadow dumb 
and there is no wind  


through the wing of the leaf 

the tree will grow over the season
and there will be shade for the ant hill 

we have been eating the skull of our friend 

and the skull to be something to fetch 
back to the road 

and there was a woman 
who was going to visit our friend
and she did not recognize the skull at first 

but when she got to the grave 
and saw the hole at the base of the grave 
she understood what the dog had dug up 

she was unsure what to do 
she was frightened 
she would chase the dog and get the skull back
but it was of no use, 
it have just become dirt in the end

she would fix the hole that the dog had made
it occurred to her as she went back to the road 

she looked at the sun, and followed the direction of her shadow </p>
<p>

carrying a skull in his mouth the dog ran 
past the well where the water had become dry and on until nighttime when the moon was white and blinding like the sun
the woman, swollen and coughing from pollen had become burnt by the glare of the moon but came to the deck that the dog hid beneath  
<br>
the tree she imagined was very far from here and she had sold it 
she was prowling towards the two eyes that bead under the deck
the dog would not flinch 
towards the dog, the dog clenched its teeth gripping the eye sockets of our friend's skull 
and it darted off, past the moon 
the woman, wounded, her neck and ankles pierced fell to her knees and sunk her nails into the grass, ripping handfuls and howling in agony 

there was the sun 
and the dog 
who slept 
and the woman 
staring up at him
he raised his neck
and tilted his head 

she grabbed him by the scruff
and said 
"you damn dog 
where'd you hide it"
and the boy came from the house
kicking open the screen door 

"listen lady 
get your hands off my damn dog"

they walked to the yard 
the skull bone was white in the sun 
the woman looked upward 
towards a cloud that passed through our friend's skull 

"that was our friend. you're a bastard kid, you're a real damn bastard" 
<br>

the woman's neck, blistered by the sunlight 
she does not know which way to go 
"my dog will go that way after breakfast you can follow him"

"I'm not following that damn dog one more step" 
the boy slams his cup of milk against the wall 

she follows the boy through the tall grass
and the dog speeds past them 
"someone's going to put an end to that dog you know" 

"someone's going to put an end to you lady" 
she grabs the boy by the shoulder


she covers the boy's mouth with her hand
a shadow looms over them, shading them from the hellish sun 

and into the sun, extending, into the dirt

the woman vomits
"this knife isn't big enough" 
"jesus man" the woman says

they continue to walk
eventually there is the truck 
covered in layers of mold and pollen and dust 

the woman reaches into the trunk 
and there is an axe. 
the boy holds the axe, angling the dullness of its edge 

they drive through the tall grass 
and they use the axe 
to retrieve the hallowed skull 

and lift into the back of the truck 
and the tooth pierces through the woman's hand 
in agony 
a ray of sunlight shining through her palm 
it is difficult for the woman to know
"it's your hand now or your arm later" the boy says 

the woman holds her hand on the gas tank 
and looks away as the boy takes off her hand
it is severed after many swings 

her screams scatter into the earth and the boy tosses her hand 
into the earth
and when she asks where her hand is, he says he does not know 

they go to the truck 
"give me the keys" says the boy 

the woman, delirious, pale and sun stroked 
reaches into her bloody jeans 
and there are the keys 

the boy will try to start the engine but to no avail 
they will have to push the truck
like a wagon toward our friend's grave 

<br>
along the truck 
the small rocks
went into the tire 

our friend's spine 
and the woman walked towards it 
the boy unloading the truck

they dragged the skull 
towards the dirt 
sacrificing it, to our friend 

it was a strange funeral 
with few words 
and it did not last long 

the boy shovelled the dirt 
and the woman drove him back to the road 

and as the boy walked through the field
he felt as though the woman did not like him 
and he felt that she would have preferred they had never met 

the boy felt a disdain and an anger towards the woman 

the boy would have wanted the woman to like him

he looked towards the light
and towards the road 
the truck driving onward 

the woman's hand severed
her wrist 
hung from the window

he watched her down the road 
and she saw the boy in the mirror and she felt pity for him 
<br>
in the evening the boy sat on his porch 
and there came the dog 
running through the grass

in the dog's jaw 
the woman's hand 
he dropped it down in front of the boy 

and the dog panted 
and he was happy to see the boy 
whose hat rested on his knee 

the boy patted his dog on the head
they would sit there 
until there was no light
<br>

the woman filled her basket and paid good money
she thought of her grandfather who once grilled his shirt and ate it 
for no other reason than to prove that he would 

the fire was dull and lame 
there were many logs in the pile and she took one and tossed it into the flame 

she took off her shirt and stabbed a stick through it and began to roast it 
the fabric folded into itself and it took a shape that reminded her of something she once saw on television 

the smoke opened from the shirt and like her grandfather she would not wait for it to cool before eating it 
and she took a bite of the shirt and chewed it and its taste was un-flavourful and meaningless 

swallowing the shirt felt harsh on her throat and each time she swallowed she felt claustrophobic
and fearful of this idiotic result 

it was clear her grandfather was a fool 
and perhaps that was the wisdom gained in this heinous act  

she went back to the truck and ate and sat on the hood of the truck 
back towards the road

still the woman sits on the hood of the truck 
watching each moment of the sun as it appears from the grass and her shadow occurs, expanding into night

and onwards for days 
until she gets back into the truck and drives along the road 

it was strange to her, the way the light and darkness continued to eclipse her 
she could not see onto the road ahead, but still continued to drive 
and she returned to the road where the boy was 
and crossed through the field and arrived at his home 

she arrived and he let her in
and they sat in silence until he slammed his fist onto the table 

and he demanded to know what she wanted from him 
and she was unsure 

he told her that their time had come to an end 
and there was nothing more to know  

and he sent her back into the truck
and kicked the truck until she drove away 

and she returned back to her home 
and looked back at the sun and looked back at the moon 

she considered that after the light 
and the lack of light 

she had misunderstood what it meant 
and she would sit on the hood of the truck

for more days and she would watch each moment of the sun as it appeared from the grass and her shadow occurred, expanding into night
and she would realize that she did understand 

and she got back into her truck 
and drove back towards the road where the boy was the sun and the moon, the dirt and the grass

the boy was surprised to see the truck return 
the woman walked towards him 
starving and delirious 
having eaten nothing but her shirt and having looked at the sun and the moon as they traded places for many days

the boy could her face and her relentless attempt 
and he became sympathetic  
for her severed hand that decomposed in the yard 

she felt that he deserved not be left on his own 
and that is what he deserved 

and he would share with her the remainder of the milk that he had left
and she would tell him about the sun and the moon 
and he would not pay attention, he would be thinking of the dirt and the grass 
another cloud would return and continue tomorrow 
a cloud, decimated and un-climactic

in the sun the cloud had felt like it had failed 
its purpose siphoned to an accidental death 

perhaps the cloud would return 
and continue on tomorrow 

</p>








<p>
there are people who sit on their porch
as a mere blur 
a rock flying through air is difficult to clarify its intent 

which rock 
which cloud 
or tree
or river 

I am in no mood to
and I have not been 
in a long time 


it is moving through the air 

That said, I would not forget
the truck when it arrives 

I have twenty five dollars cash on me 
I hope that will be enough 

onto the porch I will read my book and consider all of the books I have not read
and for that reason I do not know that the truck comes from up the road 

from the dirt 
the field 
accumulating failure 
for more money and in the interviews they will say that it isn't about the money 

or the recognition, or anything like that 

or his failures will amount to nothing but more failures 
</p>
<p>

also around that time 

I wrote 
and when I finished it, I printed it off the computer and the paper had perforated edges 

I brought the note with me 
I kept it in my pocket and I didn't show it to anyone 

and now here I am
after my life spent 
from the dirt 
no taller than the grass

the grass shifts 
but the persistent bastard does not waver by the grass
<br>
the dust 

the character who stands with his head
the character who will walk into the wall
its feet moving perpetually 
the one who repeats the same line 
over and over again

a recursive character
unsure of success
if any, 

admittedly 
–– emptying to vacuum into the trash
the dust lingering in the air 
the character 
coughs out the dust
the character continues to walk into the wall
and also coughs out the dust
the one who repeats the same line over and over again
and still coughs out the dust 

I noticed the faces,
the two fellows there 
each with long eyes  

and to say hello 
to the bastard feeling

I am perhaps an absent person 
as of late

I am trying to think of a way to describe it 
</p>

<p>

a movie ticket 
was printed 
from the automatic machine 
<br>
the person with the movie ticket went
<br>
and it was hard to admit 
that it was a terrible movie 

the person was sad on the way home 
they were sorry 
about what had happened 
and about the money wasted 

and the truck goes down the road 
past the grass 
and it becomes night 
and then day 
and then night again 

and the truck continues down the road 
to the hill and the sun

and it stops and turns off of the road 
and it drives through the grass
and the trees 

the the person stops 
and takes a jerry can 
and refuels the tank 

and the truck continues driving through the grass 
and the trees
and snapping the sticks in its tire 

and it becomes night 
and then day 
and then night again 

and again the person stops 
and takes a jerry can 
and refuels the tank 

the truck arrives at water
it drives towards it,  
and into it 

it becomes night 
and then day 
and then night again 

and the water continues to onto the trucks
for days and night and years and onward
until the truck become curved and smooth 

and it becomes a kind of rock at the foot of the water 
even to the grass 
</p>


<p>
there are many pointless emails 
that are delivered 

they go inside of pylons 
and are booted off the side of the cliff 

the pylon splashes into the water 
the emails get corrupted 

the pylon floats 
to the graveyard of emails 

the water is thick with moss 
the mosswater leads towards a truck 
</p>

<p>
yesterday, water splashed

on my pad of paper 

I am considering buying a new pair of slippers 

I have found a pair that are blue and come at a good price 


</p>

<p>

failure
and the complete collapse of failure 
the water is still
and the sun beats down onto it –– and it does not reflect back
</p>
<p>
a dirt 
envelope <br>
the message inside of it is mostly irrelevant 

at one point there was a time to be concerned 
but that time has passed 
and here we are  

as milquetoast 

I am unsure what it will have to do with<br>
something or other 

I will accept the money into my bank account 
for walking across the field 

I will become exhausted 
and covered in mosquito bites and spider bites 

that will swell on the top of my skull 
and behind my ear 
and a gas can will get hucked into the grass 

but at some point 
I would recall 
instead I will drive down the road 
and
I will stand by the generator and I will look at the gauge 
</p>
<p>

in the trees 
it is pointless to consider 
that there is no relevant meaning 

when the toast has reverted back to bread 
the loaf will un-slice itself 
and return to the bag –– protected by the clip 

there was no disposition 
in the womb 
or on the coast 

and there they are 
after all the years 


in the cold lake water 
they are merely dirt in the foam 
</p>
<p>
an umbilical chord floating aimlessly 
the truck was in a ditch
a trail of pylons led towards the lake 
the pylons under the cloud shadow 

along the rocks and dirt 
into the water 

the truck 
the pylons 
the lake 

the sun has become white 
the truck is a bacteria 
like the moss on the rock 


I have spoken on the phone 
to someone 
and I am wondering if I can have a discounted rate 
apparently it isn't a possibility and I am wondering why 

I tried to explain this to the man 
who I spoke on the phone with 
but he didn't understand 
and neither did his manager 

so here I am 
considering it
while I stand in the grass

I will call the shop again 
when they open tomorrow 
and rephrase my question 
and hopefully in the end I will get it 

I was talking to people 
and now I am unsure if I will get it 

I will consider what has happened 
</p>
<p> 
I have seen the way the pylons are stacked beside the truck 
and the truck is parked in the driveway 

and Mouse will sniff the mud on the boots that sit by the door 
to get a sense of where I have been 
for all of that time 


to enjoy 
a drink of water

I will consider what purpose things have 
as to what is necessary 
and what is utter nonsense 


and who is simply a bastard 
a hedonist 
dead on the highway 
he lay along the asphalt 
imprinted by the truck tire

I will not go over 
instead I will take what I need from this tree stump 

</p>
<p>
I have known a truck driver
and he is not dead 
he is still driving every day 

into the dirt lot 
the lift gate closed and there was a generator inside of the outhouse 
rattling the thing 
and causing the sky to jitter 

the stars were callous and reconfiguring their alignment 
and none of the trucks could get through 
into the dirt lot 

it was redundant 
and idiotic 
and inefficient 
and many of the people explained that if they were in charge 
they would never have stored the generator in the outhouse 
and left the outhouse under the lift gate 

</p>

<p>

there is a man 
watching the sun 
it causes him to squint 

he waited there all night 
but he did not see the sun again 

he walked home 
defeated 

and went to bed 
and stared at the ceiling 

he would always remember the sun
that he saw 
</p>

<p>

the truck drove into the field 
the door swung open 
the river stepped out onto the grass
stepping along the heat and the mosquitoes 
and the quiet 
he would walk along to the road 
to get a wider view 

he steered the truck
aiming it towards the bottom of the hill 

and with his arm 
pushing against the lift  
towards the river
chasing after the truck and narrowly climbing into it

the truck down the hill 
the air through a crack in the windshield 

he forgot his past 
and rotted his core 

<br>
and in the morning he would go to the sun 
under the lamp 
its ability to burn 

it is unclear what it is wisdom 
and what is coddling uncertainty 
and what is rationalizing what is 

it is obvious 
that is the skill 
to have learned

it is obvious 
that the opposite is pointless 
 
</p>

<p>

across the hill 
there is grass 
and the air is sent into the sky 
past the cloud 
exhausted 
into the vacuum 
from very far away 
they look towards it from the valley  
to hide instead of to die
in the water 
its hubris and ego are uninteresting 

</p>
<p>

as a young child I remember writing on my computer and in my notebooks 
I wrote things like I am writing now, things that calmed me down and inspired me and helped me understand who I was 

I drew cartoons and I enjoyed that 
but it was always someone else’s game 

I loved to play guitar 
but I had a hard time memorizing songs and I didn’t like relying so much on all the gadgets

I loved making movies
but there was too much compromise

I loved people 
but I couldn’t depend on them like I could this 

I haven’t made much money off of writing in my life 
and I’m not sure many people have really read my stories at the end of the day 

but I am thankful to have written in this book 
and perhaps this will be the extent of my efforts 

I will continue to reckon with that 
and I will write again tomorrow 
writing has always proved to be difficult 
I’ve grown tired of the abstract for the most part 

I’m not sure I have the strength to quit 

</p>
<p>
to read the words on the page and not understand any of them 
the inability to focus 
the mind can move too quickly 
and wander too far in too many directions
perhaps I could use a nap 

the hubris and the greed of reading 
I would like to slow my thoughts down 
to understand things better to forgo any overarching message

</p>
<p>
my legs sunburnt 
I limped around 
we looked for rocks and sticks on the beach 

continuing onward 
an ordinary moment in the sun

today 
I wonbut the next time I am forsaken to whatever unrelenting hell awaits

I got two new pairs of slippers that were a good price
and I have been occupied with changing them back and forth 

deciding which is best

I can imagine an afternoon of wearing slippers 
as being a horrendous waste of time 

but I can also imagine an afternoon of wearing slippers
as being the privilege of my life 

a moment of shallow happiness <br>
and banal contentment to recall 
<br>
when she was at the eye doctor
I asked her mother 
if she knew her daughter's ring size

and at the store there were watermelons on sale 
and we bought one 
to bring to her mother 

her mother had set her collections of rings out onto the table 
and said that she was trying them on 
to get them fixed

she found the one that fit 
and when she wasn't looking 
her mother measured the ring with a piece of floss 

I traded her mother 
the watermelon 
for the floss 

and the next day 
I went to the ring shop
and bought one with diamonds in it 

and then we went into a boat 
and paddled along the water 
for the entire afternoon 

and at the end of the day 
my legs were burnt by the sun 

and I could hardly walk for two weeks
and I sat and considered 
when I would give the ring to her 
</p>
<p>
we drove 
until the end 
and there were rocks and water 

and when I gave her the ring 
she thought I was falling over
because I was kneeling in a strange way 

she said that she would take the ring
and we decided we would be married 
in the springtime 

she said that she knew there was something strange
about the watermelon 


</p>


<p>
my cat yawns 
and I can see all his teeth 

he will snug into his chair 
and reach his paw outward 

I will pat him on the head and he will be happy and purr
and he will lick my hand 

until he changes his mind and snaps his teeth 
and gives me a bite 

he likes to fight and wrestle 
and get into any trouble he can find 

sometimes he stalks into my office and meows 
and is looking to sit on my lap 

and other times he runs around the house 
like a bandit 

he loves cooking 
and smelling the spices and flavours 

he watches intently 
and we have made many great dishes together 

I will always love to see my cat 
and I am happy when he is happy 

</p>

<p>one of the great meals of my life

down the street 
along the concrete 
and there were many people outside 

I did not care 

</p>

last night
I had no idea what I was doing
going back between the two 
and seeing what happens 

a box of salt 
on sale 
and I did not intend to buy a box of salt 

the sun beats down on the curb 
one great win  

I seem to have a disinterest at the moment 
I imagine this is due to becoming engaged 
and the birth of my nephew 

yesterday was his bris 
my father held him 
and I held my sister's dog 

</p>
<p>
we saw haystacks 
and a cloud had drifted into the parking lot 
and went into the discount store 
where we looked at clothes 

a writer doing thoughts 
from a chair at home 
or sitting in an airport 

it is difficult at times 
I think it is difficult

I am faced with some deep rooted panic 
that I thought was of good quality 

but it washed off in the lake 


I became distracted 
and I imagined that rocks had fallen into the water 
and there was no salt 
I listened to the sound 
and it was not the salt or the ocean 


it is impossible 
in its glory 

how to return 
I saw the grass 
when I returned 
and the air reminded me of being away 

this is where I will be 
until I return

</p>

<p>

some pages
write new ones 

</p>
<p>

my poor cat 
if he was stuck out in the wild 

I hope he would be able to hunt
and eat on his own 

without someone pouring him cat food
every time he meowed 

I hope he would 
hunt 

</p>

<p>towards the road 
it is obvious but one explanation is that the mule came and saw it and ate it off the ground <br>
it didn't land on the ground beside him 
or on his head 
you can tell by his tracks in the dirt

</p> 
<p>
the wind made the trees move and the sun had disappeared
the sky was odd 
it entered into the parking lot and circled around and then left 

there were few people standing and something was going on there 
there were no more cars that entered the parking lot but the one that was there already 

the wind stopped and the trees became still and the sky had become much darker and it was night

the car remained and a person paced around and spoke on their cell phone 


</p>

the sky <br>
a commemorative plaque

but most people did not care about it 
and they did not stop to read the plaque 

the man who built the plaque was not very proud of that plaque

the last thing he was going to be thinking about in his dying days 
was a dumb plaque he made 

but it was the end of his life and he did begin to think of the last things he was going to think about 
and it was strange to think about the plaque again

and
he became proud of it 

and before he died he told his family about it 
and they decided they would visit the plaque one day 

perhaps after he died 
so that they could remember him 

</p>

over the years 
I can always remember a concern  
since I had to speak in front of the class at age of four 
we had to say what we ate for breakfast 
but I was too shy to say 

so instead my friend had to tell the class on my behalf
<br>it is possible that this experience defined my life

</p>
<p>

the salt, a mound of salt
it looked like a truck was buried beneath it 

and I asked the guy there
if there was a truck inside of the salt mound
and he said no there is no truck  

</p>
a shipping container full of salt had dropped off of the boat
it creaked off the edge and it opened and formed a random constellation 

a boy walked towards the shipping container and looked inside 
he looked at the walls and saw that the salt had clustered and hardened 

he thought of his sorrow and his dreams 
the days continued 
and he brought people to walk along 

and the grass grew 
and became very tall 
and the people became lost in it 

the small rain was on the grass

it was difficult to know the difference between the salt
a formation had floated from the container
there was a leak in the ceiling and nobody moved 

the shipping container is totally empty 

I will stand in a pair of socks that have holes in the heels 
these were great socks

but must they be discarded 

</p>







a primetime drama

the tv is on in the basement and the sound is muffled 
my guess is that the downstairs neighbours are watching a primetime drama

and then Miriam came into my office 
and asked if I thought the basement neighbours had just gotten a tv 

I said yes I was just thinking the same thing 
the thoughts weren't entirely identical, but they were similar 

I think it could be categorized as the same
in this particular instance 

and now suddenly the voices have disappeared
perhaps it has come time for a commercial break

or maybe they have turned off the tv and gone for a walk
or cracked open a book 

I have just remembered I have a bite left on my banana 
the peel has been sitting on my desk since noon 

I enjoyed that banana 
and now I will drink some water



helmet 

I had spent some time today 
riding my bike 

I would recommend that to anyone 
as a great way to enjoy some time 

I had one friend who got killed on her bike 
she was wearing her helmet 

it didn't save her 
but I respect her for wearing it still 

she died a long time ago 
probably ten years now 

after she died there was some time where I used to think I saw her in the street
and I remember having the thought that she faked her death, and I suppose I thought that would have been a funny thing to do

I remember the image of thinking I saw her
that was as close to a ghost as I've ever seen

I remember her 
and I also remember her ghost the dirt farmer's hubris and the dirt farmer's golden beetroot 

my old buddy used to call people a dirt farmer 
as a dis 

it was a way of saying they couldn't grow anything 
and their soil was no good 

I would say writing can be like that 
this morning I was a dirt farmer 

but in the evening I had struck some golden beetroot 
and I was happy about that 

what else is anyone to do but aim for that
and who is anyone to tell you that is no good the cloudmaster 

the ant has crawled upward 
along the metal 
towards the sun
 
from the sidewalk
up the post 
as far as he had ever walked

he was on a streetlamp 
and the sidewalk began to seem vertical 
the road became the sky 

and he jumped from the streetlight
towards a cloud 
and he landed in the cloud 

he is now known as the cloudmaster
he is the ant in the cloud 
he is a genius dog faced glass

the dog faced glass chandelier 
had fallen from the ceiling 

and the people under it
eating their supper 

did not know that it is coming down 
until someone on the staircase screamed to warn them 

and one of the guys who was eating looked up
and he saw the chandelier plummeting towards him and he jumped out of the way

it almost hit him 
but luckily it didn't 

instead it just destroyed the table
and ruined all of the food 

the people the guy was eating with 
his wife and some of their cousins 

said the guy jumped away so fast it looked like he had turned into dog faced glass 
they said that he was a millisecond from getting totally iced 

the chandelier landed right in his chair 
they couldn't believe how lucky it was that he was the one to have heard the warning 

they said he was in the middle of a sentence and he turned into dog faced glass
they said they will never forget it the goo hand whip

some kids were in the field under the tree on the other side of the fence 
two of them had bikes and one of them didn't

the kid without the bike had some kind of string, maybe it was one of those sticky goo hand things from the arcade
and he was using it to whip a cardboard box and the other kids stared at him 

eventually one of them came back with half a cinder block and tossed it on the box
it didn't do that much damage 

the kid with the goo hand kept whipping the cardboard box 
and the others stood there, with their bikes the yolk as the sun

the egg was in the sink
and I thought of the yolk as the sun 

I spoke to a child who had a blade in their hand
they had gone off their medication and felt that the bad thoughts had stepped over the good 

there was a time when I was a child and I had gone off my medication 
and I understood what they meant about the bad thoughts in the way they stepped over the good 

I spoke to the child on the computer
knowing I would never see their face or speak to them again 

I asked them simple questions 
as I was trained to, at the crisis responce line 

there was no solution and there never is 
but to connect with one another, in a way that feels authentic enough 

there was the egg in the sink 
and I thought of the yolk as the sun 

and the blade pierced into the yolk 
and the yolk dissipated into the metal the mouse hole 

I looked closer at the ceiling and the paint was more speckled than I realized 
there was a patch mark in a place I hadn't noticed before
I wondered if there was a mouse hole in the ceiling 
like the ones in cartoons 
but in the ceiling 
not on the ground 
I lay on the couch and went back to my book 
reading the pages 
and thinking of the potential mouse hole above my head

eventually I got up on a chair 
and pushed on the part that was clearly patched over
it was a mouse hole like in the cartoons 
but it was some kind of vacuum 
and all my stuff was getting sucked into it 
I held onto the window sill for as long as I could 
even the floorboards got ripped out 
and eventually I got pulled in as well 
and now I have to find a way to escape

I am not sure if I am inside of the ceiling
or in another dimension 
or some religious purgatory 
but if there is a way to send help
I would appreciate it 
please go into my office 
and find the mouse hole in the ceiling 
I'm trapped in there 
it's right above where the couch wasmusing the napkin

a napkin on the side of the table
that someone has wiped their face with 

and then blown their nose with 

the napkin is not a handkerchief 
and it is not a paper towel 

it is a damn napkin 

and when they let go of it 
it slowly expands

and takes the form of an origami that is entirely hellish 

for those who are unaware 
I would suggest 

watching closely, the server 

as they will pocket the damn napkin 
and who knows what they even plan to do with it government forms 

I was supposed to have written my name on a government form 
but I accidentally wrote –– fleece noodles –– and I don't know why I did that 

I am staring at an extension chord 
it has been unplugged from the wall and it is powering nothing 

I cannot deal with either of these things at the moment 
because I am too busy 

what if a bird came in through the window
what if it got into the house and flew into the bath tub spout and was never seen again 

at that point I could not be bothered to talk about government forms 
I could not be bothered to worry about anything except the bird 

I will look at the window and see if there are any birds 
at the moment there are none, there are only squirrels and flies 

do not expect any of this to resolve itself anytime soon 
it is out of control the horse that searches for grass

a bag of sand 
has fallen from the truck
and landed on the road 

there was a tear in the sandbag 
and the sand went all over the road 
and there were hills in the sand 

a horse walked through the sand
and it wore a saddle 
but no one rode it 

the man who was riding the horse 
fell off long ago
the dehydration killed him 

the horse wandered through the sand
and for days had yet to see anything other than sand 
it was lucky to have come across a dead vulture 

the horse ate the vulture 
and came across some water
it was a mirage 

but it kept walking 
and the next time it saw water
it drank it and it was real 

the horse will continue walking
until it is away from the desert 
where there is grass short of stupid 

a long time ago I wrote about a peach rolling down a hill 
claiming its innocence 

the thought was totally frivolous 
so much so that I think it brought me happiness 

I have since wrote many similar thoughts 
and accumulated a lot of happiness from it all 

I am reflecting on that 
and feeling both celebratory and ashamed 

I am glad to have been so occupied by these frivolous thoughts 
and ashamed that I ... well I'm not quite sure what I'm ashamed of 

perhaps its that they are nothing short of stupid 
...

but I have always loved stupid things 
...

I will consider that for a moment 
... the view of a hole, live in concert 

the equation of sardines
the choir sang with the rock band 

a curious tree
has grown upside down and seen the inside of the hole 

there was no hole 
it was only the view of a hole 

worms, dirt and grass root 
the follicles are unparalleled 

and that's saying a lot 
considering that a hard drive fell out of the tree

and slice a root
and the green square with the circuits stuck in the grass 

and caused the earth to become a computer 
in the end it was only natural 

it said nothing about the sardines 
or the rock band choir 

but we knew they were a great band 
and hoped one day we could see them live in concert the fog

the cube truck driver drove into a town that was extremely foggy 
and there was mildew inside of the fog 

if there was a ghost in that town no one would have any damn idea
it was just too fogged out 

the headlights of the truck cut through the fog
and the coils of a toaster oven were seen in the distance 

the cube driver left the truck
and walked towards the coils 

that is when he saw the young kid
waving a rag against the toaster oven 

trying to dissipate the smoke
the smoke that was not fog 

that kid left the potatoes in there way too long 
they were burnt to a crisp 

the cube truck driver got a fire extinguisher from the truck
and he took it over and blasted it onto the toaster oven 

but it did not help the cause 
the extinguisher only added to the haze nopales, tortilla, in the dust 

there were many obstacles on the road
pylons
spikes
potholes 
nothing unusual 
strangely ordinary 

the cube truck driver dodged them all
he was a pro 
he was a great driver 
a natural 
one of the best 
and now was the real test 

the road ended
and there was only a field of cactus 
he had to get through it 
and he decided that all he could do 
was drive faster 
and risk it all 

he knew how bad things could go 
he knew what could happen 
but he still went for it 
he wasn't going to stop this truck 
turn around 
and find some other route 

he wasn't in that kind of mood 
so he ripped through the cactus field 
and shred those bastard cacti to bits 
nopales 
tortilla 
in the dust 

he made it through 
and he cracked the gatorade he was saving 
he chugged it back 
his tires were flat as hell 
that was going to be an issue 
but nothing he couldn't deal with undeleting 

sometimes I consider the people who have deleted me 
and I become upset 

the list is substantial enough 
and I have done my fair share of deleting 

but I will share some advice 
to people dealing with deletion 

in case you are thinking of 
undeleting 

the shortcut
is crtl + z the universe

the vacuum cleaner arrived and made a round but the battery died 
and it did not collect the dust bunny that was tucked between the floorboard and the panel in the corner of the room

the dust bunny is a universe in itself 
there are planets inside of it and the lamp is its sun and when it is turned off it becomes nighttime 

I would say that there is no creation myth to the universe that is inside of the dust bunny 
but there are probably a species inside of the dust bunny universe that have argued over their versions 

they have gone to war over it 
and it has been a whole ordeal 

one day some of them will travel away from the dust bunny universe in a rocket ship of sorts
and they will be incredibly grateful to return home when they do 

those who leave the planet will renounce their atheism, they will explain an all encompassing sheer awe  
they will have seen the corner of a desk and a radiator, both radical spectacles in their own right 

I respect their capacity to have faith in what is unknown to them 
it is inconsequential if they are right or wrong, the facts are irrelevant 

I love dust bunny universe 
I will continue to wonder what else has happened there the elbow scrape, the bulldog clip

I noticed a scrape on my friend's elbow and I did not ask him where he got it
I meant to, but I forgot to ask him 
and I'm only remembering it now 

a bulldog clip sat on the table and its shadow rotated with the sun
it went on for a week until the house was demolished 
and then the shadow of the rubble rotated with the sun 

I remembered that my friend was on the demolition crew 
he stood outside of the house for a week 
and the shadow of the scab rotated around his elbow with the sun 

I know that he had the scab before they demolished the house 
but I couldn't help but wonder if he'd somehow gotten that scrape on the job 
or maybe it was bulldog clip, its edges were quite sharpthe season premier 

the screwdriver had gone into the teacup
and it stayed there for a long time 

there was no tea in the teacup
and there was no hot water and no tea bag 

the hot water and the tea bag 
were floating in the air without gravity 

there was no minnow and no coral 
and there was mist surrounding the hot water

I sat at the breakfast nook 
beside the floating tea 

I yawned and became very sleepy 
and eventually I took a nap 

and when I was napping the theme music played 
for announce the beginning of the episode 

the opening credits went on my shirt 
and some of them went on the floating tea 

and when I woke up from the nap 
it was time for the episode to begin 

it was the season premier 
and I had no idea what would happen the wagon wheel 

the clear packaging was on the ground 
was from a wagon wheel 
the man saw it and looked at it 
he did not want to pick it up
but he did 
and he put it into the garbage can 
instead of the recycling bin 

the man's brother had left that morning 
he was going to suicide bomb a convenience store 
it was difficult to say goodbye 
he told him to wait until the place was empty 
and don't kill the cashier either 
he begged his brother not to kill anyone 
but he knew that wasn't the point 

there was no changing his brother's mind 
he had known that for a long time 
so he told him he should blow himself up next to the slurpee machine 
it would be like when they were kids 
and saw how many flavours they could mix into the cup
he got the laugh from his brother 
and maybe that was the best he could do 

and later that day 
when he saw the wagon wheel wrapper on the road 
he felt hesitant to pick it up
but he still did 
he just didn't have the heart to recycle it 
so instead he put it in the trash can 
it was the best he could do the goretex leaf 

there was a leaf on top of the truck 
it was incredibly small 
and it was made of goretex
it had an acute awareness of its ability to be goretex 

when the man arrived home the dog was waiting for him by the door 
the man had become a criminal in the past few weeks 
he wanted to be a criminal since he was a child 
and so he stole and attempted murder 

he did not murder or intend to murder 
he only aimed to attempt 
and the leaf on top of his truck was the evidence 
that he had been at the goretex factory 

when the dog spoke to the goretex leaf 
it barked at it through the window
and the goretex leaf explained the truth to the dog 
the dog cried when he heard what the man had done 

the dog was not a criminal 
and neither was the goretex leaf 
it was only the man 
who was the bastard a hawk snapping a rock off a cliffside

a block of wood hit a drumstick
a chicken one
not one for playing the drums 

the sound it made was like a chirp 
a hawk out on a cliffside 
snapping off a rock 

or a holographic poster
with a hawk on it 
the graphic that was also used on a hoodie that could be bought at a tourist shop 

inside of the bucket of drumsticks that someone dumped out of their van
and onto the road 
close to gutter 

a wedge, meant as a doorstop not a potato wedge
had launched out of the doorway 
and hit against the chicken bucket 

and I wondered who opened the door in such a way 
that sent that wedge flying as it did 
and I asked around but I couldn't get a straight answer out of anyone 

and that was a damn shame 
because I thought it sounded like a hawk 
snapping a rock off a cliffside 

and I would like to know how to open the door in such a way 
to make that sound, holographic 
like a hawk hoodie that could be bought at a tourist shop the crumb-lord, the pond bread 

the crust of the dolphin's crumb kingdom 
the crumb-lord, the pond bread 

the dolphin stayed in the pond in the road 
the pothole beach of the tire squeal 

someone capped it as finished 
but there was no one to survey the road 

or to dig a grave in the pond kingdom 
when the pizza slice was the sail of the boat 

that rode the gust of wind
from the tire squeal 

the dolphin was a hellish creature 
it travelled through the tar of the asphalt 

it was a worm like fellow 
who often travelled beneath the mud and to the core of the earth 

the dolphin worm often travelled to hell 
and back again, for work, it was his daily commute the styrofoam cup 

the incinerator 
turned the styrofoam cup to ash 

those ashes were swept into another styrofoam cup
and then that cup of ashes was incinerated 

and the ashes of the two cups were put into another cup 
this happened many times 

until there was a styrofoam cup that was filled to the brim 
the cup sat on the mantle and people came to look at it

they had no interest in it 
they saw it and thought that it was frivolous my skeleton friend

in the evening I was facing a surefire depression 
at the thought of the moratorium of the squeezebox

and now it has been made official 
that it's going to happen

and I have become devastated 
and inconsolable 

I have a jar of salamanders 
that I've kept in the freezer for almost four years 

I will thaw them 
and see what they have to say about the scenario

the last time we spoke they were wise 
I hope they did not get freezer burn being in there all this time 

I will also go to talk to my friend who is a skeleton 
and see what he has to say 

come to think of it I don't know if I've ever introduced the salamanders to my skeleton friend 
I think they would get along well 

that will have to be what I do tomorrow 
I think it will be a good one yes

I have realized that I have been in a persistent negative state 
regarding the visualization of an unsuccessful future 

I think this is my default mindset 
and there have been times where I've worked to get ahead of it 

I don't know if I'll ever be able to let go the idea that I am destined to fail 
I understand the logic that visualizing failure will lead to exactly that 

what I am talking about in specific is my ability to build a career off of my ability to write stories 
this is a goal I've had for a long time, for over ten years, it has had control of me

I have a western story that I finished recently 
I really do like it 

I will edit it a few more times and then send it out to some dear readers 
I will see how it feels then

I'm not trying to spite what I wrote earlier about my persistent negative state 
but I could see how people would really enjoy that story 

I will try to keep sight of that feeling 
as I get ready to send it out into the world when I am sleeping I will have no idea about anything 

I was hoping to have opened the window today 
but I did not get around to it 

I would like to have had a chance to have opened the newspaper
but my eyes became very sleepy 

I will have to go into the bed
and put my head onto the pillow and go under the blanket

I will close my eyes and eventually I will fall asleep 
and when I am sleeping I will have no idea about anything 

I will wake up and I will go to the window 
and I will open the window 

I will get the newspaper and I will open it 
and I will pour the coffee and drink it 

and I will see what is going on 
in the yard and in the world 
the tape measurer 

it is strange that the wind moves the leaf outside the window 
it is dark and quite frightening if I am being honest 

when I was young I used to extend my dad's tape measurer as far as it would go
I would release it and then run to the other side of the room as it snapped shut 

I have a tape measurer here 
if there is a demon out there in the leaves I will extend the tape measurer to maximum 

and release it 
that would destroy him the garter snake is the man 

the garter snake is the man 
and he rules the dirt 

he is fast enough that he will disappear before you can even see him 
he once ate an entire chicken, uncooked, still living 

that chicken was just walking along the path 
thinking about his eggs 

and the garter snake came over and chomped him down in one bite 
I couldn't believe it 

I would say that you should watch out for him when you're walking around 
but it wouldn't matter 

he will do whatever he wants 
there's no stopping himwhat thoughts had been forgotten when the grasshopper brains melted into the sun 

extended cabbage 
has overtaken the keyboard 

lasagna noodles have destroyed the world 
and 

there are grasshoppers that have survived 
in outer space 

albeit some of their heads exploded 
their tiny grasshopper brains went melting into the sun 

what thoughts had been forgotten 
when the grasshopper brains melted into the sun 

we will find out 
when we give the sun a polygraph test 

it is heat resistant 
and non-stick 

meaning the cabbage and lasagne noodles 
will wash off easily some doddling bastards 

every once in a while... 
it is good to be right at the end of the day 

I was losing sleep over some doddling bastards 
but in the end I feel like I kicked ass 

because I knew what I was talking about 
and I knew what I was doing 

so I will suggest to you 
if you really know what's going on 

then make sure no one will cause you any grievance 
and if you know what you're doing then you will kick their ass in the end 

by default 
without even tryingtofu block

I may have spoke too soon 
the complication arose again and the doddling bastard returned 

it is horrendous to waste time 
and this ongoing instance of total idiocy has lost me hours 

I have never used the term sayonara
but I would love to 

it is futile to have become as angry as I am 
but the feeling remains for the time being 

I would prefer to write my stories in peace 
then have to deal with these perverse infidels 

I will have to let it go 
and return to my tofu block curiously I have triumphed 

curiously I have triumphed 
and this is for the reason that I have written my story in such a way that I am extremely pleased 

it is a story about a man that gets his wagon stolen 
and he goes with a boy to cross through the valley and catch the bandits who stole it 

there are many pages about the bandits as well 
I think it is the best story I have ever written 

when I read it over tonight and made my edits 
I had some good laughs and enjoyed it all quite a bit 

there is one scene of gratuitous violence that I may feel the need to change
and maybe something about the final page 

but really it's okay 
I'll keep thinking about it 

but otherwise I think it will be a great story for all
and I will look forward to seeing how it is for people the ring bearer

the dog skeleton 
is currently sitting in his hotel bed 
wearing a robe and reading a magazine 
while watching tv 

he will be the ring bearer at the wedding 
he will wear a tuxedo 
and walk up the aisle 
when it is time 

the wedding is of his half sister
she is marrying some guy
the dog skeleton could care less
about him

the dog skeleton will prepare a bubble bath 
and order room service 
and drink from the mini fridge 
he doesn't know or care who is paying for all of this 

it was strange for him to have been dug up from his grave
but his half sister always imagined that her dog 
would be the ring bearer 
at her weddingthe ring bearer II 

after the wedding the dog skeleton realized something 
those bastards were going to try to trap him and put him back in the ground 

he bolted down the hallway, past the elevator 
towards the stairs 

he ran down them so fast his paws barely touched the steps 
and he tumbled out into the street 

he ran down the road and towards the highway 
and he didn't stop until he'd outrun every car and truck out there

and there he was
alone in the grass

he was free 
from death and from everyone 

and it hit him then 
an unbearable wave of longing and nostalgia 

he had just ran away 
and he had no idea how to get back home 

he howled and looked at the daylight moon 
maybe things weren't so bad at the hotel there

with the robe and the tv and the bubble bath
and the mini fridge 

maybe he could stay there from now on 
and make that his new home 

maybe that wouldn't be so bad 
so he returned back the way came 

he walked slowly and carefully, 
unsure of what was to come the ring bearer III

the dog skeleton continued down the road 
the wind carried the sand through his ribs as he walked

he stopped at some gas station and licked up the water bowl 
that they left out for the other dogs 

he listened to the song on the radio that played for the customers
and it made him feel calm and hopeful that he would be able to make the trip back

he walked along the road for some time 
until he arrived in the town 

he searched everywhere for that hotel 
and the moment he found it he saw a familiar minivan pulling out of the parking lot 

it turned onto the road and headed off 
he ran after it, as fast as he could 

he could hardly keep up to it
but then the side door slid open 

and his half sister jumped out of the van
and landed on the road

she fell and tumbled like a devil stick 
and when she got up blood gushed from her forehead

the dog skeleton looked at her 
and barked

she smiled at him and gave him a hug
and the minivan crashed into a tanker truck ahead 

the explosion burst into the clouds 
and the sky became orange and roasted 

that was when the dog skeleton knew 
that he would always be her dog the duck 

a duck came into the seven eleven 
he was wearing a balaclava mask and had a gun he'd stolen off a cop 

he took flat of wonder bread and told the employee 
that it was just bread so don't get all worked up about it 

there was a man at the slurpee machine 
he was so scared that just held the cream soda spout open and it overflowed the cup and poured all over his hand 

the duck took as much bread as he could carry, he filled his jacket and held them under his arms 
and then he shot the employees and the slurpee guy 

that duck was crazy
he really didn't have to kill all those guys but he just couldn't resist 

he was a killer 
through and through

he got into his truck and sped out of the parking lot 
he drove out of that city and never came back again revolving taquitos 

the moon lowered 
and eventually crashed into the ceiling of the seven eleven

it was just their luck
those bastards had their bread robbed by a damn duck just one day ago 

and now this 
the light fixtures fell from the ceilings and smashed into the potato chips

as if those lights weren't bright enough already 
now they were practically blinded by this sickle moon

a frequent customer was picking sour worms 
and some random cowboy was leaned over and studying the revolving taquitos 

those guys were in desperate need of an ambulance 
both of the employees were alright, one of them was out on a smoke break when it happened 

an entire fridge of energy drinks had been split in half 
the incision was totally symmetrical 

the employee stood behind the till and screamed 
while the other one had his headphones in, and had yet to turn aroundseven eleven coffee

the sun had risen and every news outlet in town was crammed into the seven eleven parking lot 
they filmed the damaged ceiling and tried to get interviews with the employees and the customers 

it was the first time that the moon had caused this much damage 
and people all over the world were talking about it 

the seven eleven did great business that day
though it wasn't enough to truly offset the cost of the damages that the moon caused

despite the destruction and the dire need to repair 
the seven eleven could not close

the business prided itself on being open twenty four hours a day
and seven days a week 

for those who might be in need of late night snacks 
or coffee or cigarettes or lotto tickets 

eventually the news trucks left 
and the construction workers stood in the parking lot 

they discussed how to repair the damage 
and they drank the coffee that had just been brewed for themthey were still unsure how to rebuild the seven eleven

they worked all day 
and came up with a lot of ideas 
but they were still unsure 
how to rebuild the seven eleven 

one of the construction workers 
brought up a good point 
it was getting dark 
and the moon would be more full tonight 

they wondered if they should bring in cranes 
or tanks 
or set up a protective dome
but they weren't fools and they knew none of those things would work 

so they bought another round of coffees
and some hot dogs and chips 
and they waited throughout the night 
and then watched the moon as it travelled throughout the sky 

they weren't sure what they would do
if the moon did come and destroy the seven eleven again 
but they wanted to be there to help
most of the guys fell asleep in their trucks anyway 

when they woke up 
they realized everything was as alright as it was 
and they were happy about that 
they cheered and patted each other on the back 

until one of the guys went inside 
and he got the newspaper 
there was a front page story about a seven eleven in Taiwan that got obliterated 
it wasn't prettyI know a lot has happened this week regarding the seven eleven 

the bricks are pointless 
at the seven eleven 
the chips and slurpee machines 

lottery tickets, candies 
comic books, newspapers 
hot dogs

there are so many awesome things to get at that store 
and I barely even go these days
I went once last summer for a slurpee, that's it

other than that I never go 
there is one very close to my house 
I am moving soon 

I know that a lot has happened this week regarding the seven eleven 
but that doesn't mean it's too late to go 
that doesn't mean I couldn't just grab a chocolate bar some time 

or even grab a slurpee 
it's not that cold out 
I have gloves a final note on the slurpee

it was windy and the traffic on the road was relentless 
nobody slowed down to see the seven eleven anymore 

I walked by and looked at it from the other side of the street 
the roof was tarped off, where the moon had hit 

we were on the way to return a library book 
and there were two kittens on the sidewalk ahead

they each wore a collar and they swatted at a piece of metal 
it seemed they belonged to the variety & grocer corner store

they played in the sandwich board that had the lotto max sign 
and they didn't go far from the store 

after we returned the book to the library 
there was an old woman who tried to catch the bus 

she yelled a boy who was going towards the bus 
and got him to help her with her walker and she leaned on him as she got on

on the way back home I looked at the seven eleven again 
we didn't go in

I'll get that slurpee one day 
when the time is right the legacy of the worm

it had been raining and the worm ended up on the sidewalk 
he did not know which way to go 
to get back to the mud 

it was inevitable that he would die but he did not want to die 
he dreamed of being struck by lightning 
he had a friend who said it was awesome

his friend said it was transcendent 
and that after he was struck he understood the core of his being 
and that after he was struck he was no longer afraid to die 

until now the worm was scared of lightning 
but now it seemed like the only path to mercy 
he wiggled and stood up to the sky, hoping to be struck the legacy of the worm II 

as it happened 
the worm saw the world as it always had been 
he considered a post it note 
and knew the dye of its ink 
and the taste of the glue that held it to the wall 

to realize he had never seen a post it note before
and had no conception of its purpose
or existence 
was a testament to the power  
of the lightning bolt that struck him 

the worm felt a euphoric neutrality 
he felt everything and nothing at all 
his feelings were composted in his stomach 
they fertilized and parasitized his being 
and he became something new 

when the storm ended 
he saw his shadow for the first time 
it did not follow him was he walked towards the grass
and while he no longer feared his death 
he had forfeited what it meant to be alive the legacy of the worm III

the predicament of the worm 
he looked towards the blades of grass 
they split infinitely around him 
his shadow killed by the sun 

he did not know what happened 
but when he turned 
he had been severed into two
he was now two worms 

the bolt of lightning had already shocked his mind
evaporating his fear and ambition 
his shadow left in the sun
and now he was of two minds

his senses doubled
he saw from two angles in whichever direction 
he looked at himself 
and the mirror imagine echoed infinitely 

he tried to speak to himself 
but the words would not form
he needed to find a friend 
someone who could help him 

he walked towards the grass
and his other mind 
stared at where his shadow had been 
on the sidewalk

the legacy of the worm IV 

the sun burned onto the worm through the grass and on the sidewalk 
its skin became dry and it was difficult to see 

the worm was unaware of its sense of self from that moment onward
but it was cognizant of its divided half 

it felt no competition 
and it felt no empathy 

and the mirror thoughts came 
from the world of the sidewalk to the worm in the mud 

as the mud worm ventured further into the grass towards the slide
it had to cross through the gravel 

this was a path that turned worms into nails 
and unfortunately there was no path that turned a nail back into a worm 

still the sidewalk worm considered its being 
but as it reached enlightenment, the past became obsolete 

and the sidewalk worm no longer cared about the seagull beak
or the skateboard wheel or whatever the culprit of its separation was 

as this sidewalk worm was here now 
the mud worm lost bearing of its intent 

the mud worm was half way through the gravel 
it was almost at the slide 

it knew that the slide metal would cause the mud worm to congeal
but he had to get up there to talk to his friend the legacy of the worm V 

the mud worm went up the slide 
the heat burned him 
and the sidewalk worm ignited like a match and he screamed as he melted back into a shadow 

the mud worm climbed to the top of the slide but a wash of prickly bubbles washed onto him
a soda
someone had knocked over a bottle of cream soda and it poured onto the mud worm 

he moved onward and came to the bottle 
he crawled inside, but did not realize it 
since it was glass 

the mud worm was trapped in the cream soda bottle
the sidewalk worm had become ash 
and that is when the bottle was lifted 

and someone screamed "worm!" 
they tossed the bottle into the air 
and it floated through the skythe legacy of the worm VI

the inside of the bottle still had a thin glaze of cream soda and the worm looked out at the playground and the grass and the sidewalk 
a bird flew towards the bottle and tried to catch the worm and was unable to penetrate its forcefield, the bird could not see the glass and it hurt its beak
the bottle sunk downwards and the worm felt its gut turn as it plummeted towards the gravel
there was a moment of stillness that made the worm feel an immense panic that not even that bolt of lightning could zap out of him 
the bottle smashed onto the gravel and its pieces scattered 
the kids ran towards the mess and looked at the worm as he tensed and stretched and did everything he could to force his way through the glass
one of the kids tried to pick up the piece of glass that the worm was on and he cut his finger on its edge, the kid cursed and dropped it, the angle was close to severing the worm into another mind again but he dodged the edge in time 
the worm squiggled onward through the rocks and head in like a tick in skin 
and from there he dug and celebrated the panic and the fear of death that the sun had caused him to feel back on the sidewalk 
in some time the worm found his way beneath the surface and back into the mud
he stayed there and he felt it was a pleasant home 
and the next time it rained he was pleased that when he came to the surface he was surrounded by a field of grass 
it was tempting to go towards the sidewalk, to see if his shadow returned 
he was hesitant at first 
but then he went over there
he did not see his shadow, or his other mind 
he would have to wait for the sun the dish glove

the legacy of the worm was a good story 
it wasn't the best thing I've ever written 
but it wasn't bad

if I was to write a similarly formatted story in this moment 
I might make it about a pink dish glove that had ripped on the side of a dumpster
that might be a good one 

it would be a take place around the first snowfall 
the dish glove would be crisp with the frost 
and there would be some black goo on it 

it was unclear what the source of the black goo was
the inside of the dumpster was empty 
aside from the glove that hang over its edge 

but for anyone who took notice to the steam coming from the sewer 
and watched it trail up along the side of the building 
they would see 

the bear's corpse 
that floated up by the fire escape
on the fifth floor the dish glove II 

a police car drove into the alleyway 
its sirens were on and they flashed along the brick 
the cops got out of the car, their guns were drawn 

they walked towards the dumpster
and they saw the pink glove that was called in
the cop who got out of the passenger seat told the other cop to look up 

she did and she saw the bear 
she cursed and was shocked
the bear was frozen in mid air like floating taxidermy 

the passenger cop went into the trunk and got the shotgun 
the driver slowly walked towards the dumpster and the bear 
as she walked towards it the music began to swell

the music was scary 
and it sounded like something very bad 
was going to happen 

she was brave and went towards the dumpster 
the passenger had the shotgun now and pointed it in front of him 
and then there was a screech, something unexpected 

the driver shot off a round 
he didn't have great nerves 
and the bullets ricocheted back and hit him

he fell backwards 
the driver went towards where the bullet hit 
there was a wall of resin between them and the dumpster and the bear 

she rushed over to the passenger 
he was bleeding out 
she screamed into her radio for backup 

she said that officer daniel was down 
and needed medical attention 
immediately 

the music still droned on 
it was coming from the other side of the resin wall 
it was coming from the dumpster or the bear's jaw the dish glove III 

that cop was taken off to the hospital 
he was in critical condition 
he was in a coma 

they brought in a lot of people to try to understand that resin block in the alleyway 
it seemed like the liquid had been poured in a perfect rectangle over the fire escape and the dumpster and the dish glove and the bear 
and it just hardened like that

they found the speakers where the music came from 
they couldn't get it to shut off and one cop lost his temper and smashed it to bits 
they found the iPod it was attached to 

the cop sat under a tinfoil blanket for a long time 
she stared at the scene 
and her gut told her it was frivolous 

she said it looked like some bullshit from the moma 
or some stupid thing from a movie set 
two bullshit things 

she went to visit her partner in the hospital 
the doctors weren't sure if he was going to pull through 
she sat in his room and fell asleep in the chair by the window 

after less than forty five minutes she was awoken by a phone call 
she answered it 
and what she didn't understand 

what made her skin crawl 
was that voice on the line 
it sounded just like officer Daniels 

the man who lay in a coma beside her
and the voice on the line swore to her 
that it was himthe dish glove IV 

the cop listened to the phone call 
and was petrified 

officer Daniels lay in the bed
he was comatose 

he spoke to her through the phone 
he asked her to turn on the television 

she did so
and they watched old music videos together 

she asked him if he would survive 
and he said he didn't think so 

but she could always call him back 
if she ever wanted to talk 

she told him he was a good cop
and hung up the phone 

she got herself a cup of coffee 
and then she went back to the crime scene 

she looked at the bear 
that floated by the fire escape

and she looked at the pink dish glove 
that hung on the dumpster's edge 

she knew that all of the other cops on the force were incompetent
and that if she wanted to find her partner's murderer 

she would have to figure it out
herself  the dish glove V 

the cop sat in the alleyway and stared at the resin block for a long time 
she came back every single day for months and discovered nothing 

no one at the station knew who put the call in 
dispatch was clueless 

the city brought a battering ram to the resin 
and it would not break 

the city brought a jackhammer to the resin 
and it would not break 

the city brought a wrecking ball to the resin 
and it would not break

six months passed 
and officer Daniel was still in a coma 

she spoke to him on the phone often 
almost every night 

her back was really messed up from sleeping in the hospital chair every night 
but she was too busy working on the case to stretch it out 

and one night when she slept 
she was awoken by a massive earthquake 

the entire city was destroyed 
she was covered in rubble 

her head was covered in blood and she limped out 
from under a concrete block 

she did not know where officer Daniel was 
almost everyone in the city had been swallowed into the earth and would not be found again 

the cop walked back to the resin block
and it remained 

the bear floated at the top
the pink dish glove and dumpster below it 

but now that the road had broken open below 
she saw that it continued 

the resin totem pole had many items inside of it 
including a ball of slime, a miniature beach and a piston 

she looked out at the city 
it had been levelled 

and at this point 
the dust had yet to even settle the dish glove VI 

the resin block was the only thing left in the whole city
the cop looked at it and still had no idea what it was for 

she went down into the cavern and it led into earth 
there were strange creatures down there 

there were tyrannosaurus rex's the size of ants 
and floating squids 

she found a massive blueberry tree 
and went swimming in a hot spring

life was good down there for a while
eventually, to her surprise, she found a power outlet 

she found a cell phone charger 
and as luck would have it, it happened to fit her cell phone 

she plugged it in and booted it up 
and she called officer Daniel 

he said things were going alright for him 
all things considered 

she said that things were pretty good for her too 
but it was almost time for her to come back to the surface 

and go back
to being a cop a strange shape beneath a section of the rug 

I will admit that I noticed something unordinary 
there was a strange shape beneath a section of the rug 

it was near where I had vomited on the ground 
a long time ago

I looked under it and saw that there was a deep hole
and a layer of what may have been cosmic goo 

it sounded like a vacuum in slow motion 
with a strange echo 

I was worried it was something that I should not mess with 
so I covered it back up with the rug 

perhaps I will tape some cardboard overtop of it 
tomorrow before I take my cat to the vet a strange shape beneath a section of the rug II

when I woke up I went and looked at the portal 
it had not changed 

I went up the street into my neighbours recycling bin 
and fished out a cardboard box 

it was meant for bulk lettuce
they probably got it from costco 

I taped the lettuce box down and put the rug over it 
and then I took my cat to the vet 

when I returned home 
the entire rug was missing 

and the cardboard was gone also 
I should have known it didn't stand a chance 

I've been trying to get my work done all day 
but this damn hole keeps echoing and making all kinds of vague noise 

I told my cat not to go anywhere near it 
he said he wasn't planning on it a strange shape beneath a section of the rug III

I wasn't planning on dealing with the portal today 
I had a lot to do and I didn't sleep well 

but I guess I was procrastinating 
I was bleeding out in a game of chess and I wasn't sure how to approach my book 

so I took the radiator 
and I tossed it down there 

and it floated 
about five feet away 

I stared at it for a long time 
and then I tried to get some more work done

and when I looked at it again 
the radiator was more like one hundred feet away 

it keep going down 
until it was a tiny dot, a little star 

it seems like there's no vanishing point down there 
things get smaller than I've seen before 

it's like they get so small they start to swell out 
and you can see what they're made up from 

I'm going to toss some more stuff down there 
to see about any constellations 

I will say that I regret tossing the radiator down there
I needed that thing a strange shape beneath a section of the rug IV

when I returned to the room I saw the radiator had returned to its original location 
and the constellation simmered to a mere flicker

the radiator looked unscathed and it turned on fine 
but there was something different about it 

its purpose had become so blatant 
it felt almost satanic in nature 

it had no bearing aside from its strict use 
and its inanimate features had become deafeningly prominent 

I looked at the radiator and thought of these far fetched descriptions 
and as I said before, it felt damn near satanic 

I tossed in the lamp and it burned through what seemed like a little dipper 
but it returned too and I felt like it came out with a clarity of use that gave me a great irritation 

I swept dust into that portal 
thinking it could work like some trash bin 

and I kept dumping things in there 
I tossed my chair in and it only returned to its original location, my computer too 

I created some kind of galaxy there 
and I didn't know what to make of it 

I was thinking of talking the neighbour into jumping down there
to see what would happen 

but I couldn't work up the nerve
I decided I'm going to have to do it myself 

I'm going to pack a knapsack with a couple sandwiches 
and get to the bottom of it a strange shape beneath a section of the rug V

it was strange to be in the portal 
I was surprised I had the courage to go in 

I walked for a long time 
eventually some dirt formed under my shoes but I couldn't see it well 

the only light was from the strange constellations above 
I looked at them and then a brontosaurus came into my view

we spoke and he introduced me to his buddy 
the triceratops 

I sat with them
and we shared the peanut butter sandwiches I packed

they taught me about how they did things 
we sat and talked for a long time 

they asked me why I left my home 
and I told them I didn't know 

they asked if I was alright 
and I said I suppose I had been feeling lost 

the triceratops asked if I knew the way back 
I told him I thought that I did 

he told me to follow the radiator star 
and said that I would 

I said goodbye to my friends 
and walked for a long time 

my feet were sore and I wanted to go home 
but I didn't know where I was going 

even though I told the triceratops 
that I thought I did a strange shape beneath a section of the rug VI 

how I got out of that portal wasn't complicated
I just kept walking 

it took a long time
and I wish I brought another couple sandwiches 

but eventually I reached the end 
and I climbed out of it 

I went into the kitchen and ate everything in the fridge 
cucumber, eggs and all kinds of stuff 

since then I have been catching up my reading 
and writing my new book 

I still look at that portal and think about those guys down there 
I thought for a moment there was something out there for me 

and maybe there was 
but it wasn't my home 

instead, for now 
my home is here there is an exhaust pipe or something 

I would say that it feels like there is an exhaust pipe 
or something 

burning into my collar bone 
like there is a truck driving across the top of my rib cage 

it’s a semi truck, driving across at a decent pace, 
especially considering the truck is smaller than a millimetre

its been causing my thoughts to move quickly all afternoon 
my questions are as follows 

where is the truck going 
what is in the truck 

how much fuel is left in the tank 
where is the nearest gas station 

who is driving the damn thing 
and who is paying them for the job 

what radio station are they tuned in to 
and what songs have been played 

I have looked within to find the answers 
but have discovered nothing 

except that 
a cat

has clawed through the road 
there are four long incisions that have dragged along the asphalt 

and the truck is getting wrecked 
from how bad the road is messed up 

I am less worried about the road 
and more anxious to find out 

where the cat is hiding 
and when it will pounce I don’t want to be a nihilist or an anarchist or an abscess 

it is naive to strive for intelligence 
or authenticity 
or honesty 
the more I strive to understand those virtues the further I get from them 

I don’t want to be a nihilist or an anarchist 
or an abscess 

I don’t want to pretend that I don’t care what other people think 
but I do want to have the integrity to own up to who I am

that has been difficult 
and I see my deficit 

it is hard to be yourself 
it is hard to know yourself by the end of the day I felt better about it

I had woken up this morning at about four thirty 
I drank my coffee and played a few chess moves 
and got to work 
writing back some emails and working on my story 

at the beginning of the day I felt that the story was busted 
but by the end of the day I felt better about it 
I burnt the lint off the sock 
and now it’s working better

there is a leaf below the radiator 
it is dried and covered in dust 
it looks like a dead house centipede 
its shadow has extended across the hardwood 
the blanket 

I was able to get from the rooftop 
to the fire escape on the next building 
by using a blanket 
as a cape 

I was scared out of my mind 
and I had no idea if I would actually make it
but I really wanted to give it a shot 
and it was worth the risk 

I’m not sure if I will try it again 
it felt really dangerous 
I banged my knee up 
it’s sore today I do not know what will happen perhaps they will take them to the grave 

I was eating crackers while writing in my notebook 
and now there are crumbs on the tabletop, and the notebook and on my sweater

I will wipe them off onto the ground 
and then when I keep writing in my notebook I will forget I did that and step on the crumbs and make them go into the rug 

I could go get the vacuum
but am I really expected to vacuum every time I eat a cracker? 

one day those crumbs will turn to dust
or be eaten by a bug or a rodent 

perhaps they will digest them into the soil or take them to the grave
from there I do not know what will happen 

yarn 

there were veins knotted into a ball 
like yarn 
and there was someone using them to sew a cardigan 
they sat in the middle of the street 
with their feet dangling in the sewer 
whistling
it seemed like they were on a productive streak
I can imagine the oncoming traffic being quite distracting 
I assumed they would have gotten smoked by a vehicle eventually 

a few years later I saw a sweater at the thrift store
it looked very similar 
it smelled rotten 
and I was surprised to see they were trying to get thirty bucks for the thing 
I saw a guy try it on and he seemed to like it 
he stared at himself in the mirror for a long time 
it really looked like he was going to buy it 
but in the end he just tossed it overtop of the other sweaters
he didn't even hang it back onto the rack the camel 

the camel had walked through the sand for a long time
eventually the desert ended 
and he arrived in the woods
where he met the wolf

the wolf tried to eat the camel 
but in the end did not 
he saw that despite its reputation 
the camel was in fact a vicious beast 

they both agreed that despite their differences 
there did not need to be anymore bloodshed 
they decided they would join together 
and find others who agreed with them 

and many others did agree with them 
they created a kingdom 
of fierce warriors 
who agreed there did not need to be anymore bloodshed

eventually they ate only vegetables and beans and nuts
they spoke to one another at a safe distance 
they got ergonomic chairs 
some of them were happy and others were not 

and then one day 
the camel killed the wolf
he slit the bastards throat 
when he was sleeping 

and when the camel sat on death row
they asked him why he did it
he said the whole thing was just a rouse 
to stop the wolf from eating him the box of crackers 

a box of crackers floated down the river 
past the rocks, away from the mountain 

the cardboard got wrecked
but the plastic wrapping kept them safe 

there were some hikers in the mountain 
that stopped for lunch 

they opened their knapsacks 
and they did not find the crackers 

one of the guys was really let down by that 
he had been thinking about those crackers for hours 

he tried to stay calm but lost his temper 
he screamed and threw a rock into the air 

the rock flew upwards against the snow 
and landed in the river 

it clunked against another rock 
and splashed unclimactically 

the other hikers were annoyed by him 
they were annoyed that he got so worked up 

but most of all
they were annoyed he lost the box of crackers the man in the neon orange hat

the man attached a battery to a piece of chocolate cake
and put it in the microwave 

it became melted sparks 
it was a waste of cake and a waste of a good battery 

he was a destructive man 
and he often said he hated peace 

when he tried putting a dolphin in a wood chipper 
he was shot by a man in a neon orange hat

the man in the neon orange hat told the court why he shot the peace hating man 
he said it was because he tried putting a dolphin in a wood chipper

that was his defence
and he stuck to it 

the man in the neon orange hat appealed the case many times 
and I'm happy to report that he is now free 

no one wanted to see him go to jail 
for saving that dolphin the baseball hat 

a baseball hat floats in the air 
it is not in the wind 

there is a rip in the gravity 
it is in a vortex

above the park 
and there are no trees in the background 

just the grey sky 
and a building's exhaust 

after six weeks or longer
the hat moved like it was being dragged by a computer mouse 

it went towards a busy street 
outside of a pawn shop

there was steam coming from a sewer 
and there were no buildings in the background 

just the grey sky 
and it began to snow the formidable ego 

I can see the side of my mind that wants to take the simple way 
and write my new story in a ten thousand word version 

I can see the side of my mind that wants to transcend that 
and write towards the sixty thousand word mark 

both are great versions 
and have their benefits 

and both quite small
in comparison to a lot of books out there 

it is remarkable how rapidly my brain switching between the ideas 
and how relentless its obsession over which version will be better

it is stressful to manage my ego 
it is stressful to battle its attempt to prove its worth 

it is formidable 
I will look forward to approaching the day with a fresh mind 

I will look forward to forgetting this nonsense 
and getting back to work the rifle is imaginary and there is no alleyway 

I have cornered my ego
in an imaginary alleyway 
with an imaginary rifle
and I have demanded to know 
what it wants

the damn ego is like a dog with its tail between its legs
or however the saying goes 
it is ashamed of itself
it knows what it did 
but it begs for mercy 

I could shoot it down 
and it would play dead 
but it knows better than me 
that the rifle is imaginary 
and there is no alleyway 

instead I will have to make peace with my ego 
and do my best to finish my writing 
and see if the ungrateful bastard 
can learn a bit of gratuity 
for all the work I've done 

instead of working my ass off
and every time I finish something 
getting all excited 
and making me think I've gotten somewhere great
and then sending me into some crippling paralysis 

determining the work not good enough 
and squandering away 
into the next project
without really getting the work out there
in the way it might deserve

I suppose that imaginary alleyway and that imaginary rifle 
become less imaginary 
when they're pictured in someone else's head too
so that's probably a good thing 
the more real they getchasing the laser beam as he does

it has been a great pleasure to sit at my desk today 
I have sat with good posture 

I have worked on my new book 
and I think I will be proud of the work when it is completed 

I have won a game of online chess
and lost another 

I ate rice and tofu and eggs 
and drank my coffee 

I prepared my lecture for tomorrow 
and the next day and the day after that 

this will be the three hundred and ninety ninth post on this site 
and tomorrow will be the four hundredth 

I would say that's pretty good 
and I would like to say thank you to all of the people who have come back each day to read 

including my cat
who has run across the room 

chasing the laser beam
as he does one kid's mom 

I will enjoy a plate of scrambled eggs 
any day of my life 

I remember one kid I grew up with 
his mom cooked scrambled eggs in the microwave 

she whipped the eggs in the bowl
added salt and pepper 

put on saran wrap 
and then nuked it 

they turned out alright 
but it wasn't me 

I like to whip them up in a bowl 
and make sure the pan is really hot 

and then pour in the egg
and scrape it around with a fork 

it turns out good that way
I think the key is waiting until the pan is at hot as it can be 

until just before the oil smokes 
and you have to whip the egg with everything you've got 

once the egg hits the pan 
crank the heat right down 

and cook them up 
that's how I make it happen the pane of glass

a pane of glass frisbees through the street 
almost chopping off a guy's head 

it hits the windshield of a sedan 
and shatters 

both the glass from the windshield 
and the pain of glass 

they mixed together 
on the street 

the driver of the sedan 
took off his glasses 

in disbelief 
only to realize

his lenses had smashed too 
the traffic was backed up for a long time

eventually it was discovered that the pane of glass 
had come frisbeeing off the back of a truck

that took a corner too fast 
a few blocks aheadtowards the forest below 

a panel of wood 
has come flying towards the forest 

from the sky 
it plummets 

and slices a tree clean in half 
a squirrel 

narrowly missed 
being severed at the abdomen 

he did not blink for almost a minute 
after that 

he did not see his life flash 
before his eyes 

he saw a panel of wood 
slice a tree 

clean in half 
and it scared him half to death 

the squirrel walked out of the forest
into the clearing 

he saw a helicopter
in the distance 

it spun out 
towards demise 

the door of the  
shipping container 

it carried 
was wide open 

and many 
planks of wood 

flew outward 
slicing the air beneath them 

and plummeting
towards the forest below dried shrimps

It isn't uncommon that when I sit to write 
I think of beginning with 
the phrase 
the dolphin 

the truth is I am relatively indifferent to dolphins 
I don't think about them often
I have seen a few before 
but not as many as a lot of people 

but sometimes when I sit in my chair 
and the phrase occurs to me 
the dolphin 
and it repeats 

I will recommend an invention for someone to make
I have seen very small dried shrimps before
a quarter of an inch 
and I would suggest someone make a tiny dried dolphin like that 

people can add it to their soup
or to their rice
and it will be an added flavour 
they could enjoy 

they could be sold in bulk 
and probably would cost a lot 
like a pine nut to an almond 
or something of the sort 

I will leave that for anyone who it is useful too
and if it is useful to no one 
that is okay as well 
I don't mind 
a small circular tupperware

I walked outside of the house today 
and noticed a small circular tupperware 
there was some dried cat food in it 
maybe a third full 

it seemed that the container was tied to a fishing line
or floss
and I looked upward 
to see where it was coming from 

it seemed to be coming from a particular cloud 
I don't know how many miles upward 
higher than a helicopter could go 
but perhaps a plane could get there 

I went into the shed 
and took my ladder
and I went to the airport 
and I bought a ticket to some city that was in the direction of the cloud 

it was difficult to convince them to let me bring the ladder onto the plane 
but eventually they gave in 
I leaned it against the seats 
in the aisle 

when the plane took off 
I went to the pilot and told him I needed him to stop the plane 
he refused
so I went and pulled the emergency exit

I took my ladder on top of the plane 
and climbed up it 
and got to the cloud 
that had the finishing line hanging from it 

and there he was 
my cat 
he was the one that set up the container 
he was trying to trick me 

I went to grab the fishing line but he was too fast 
he took it and jumped off the cloud with it 
I followed him and jumped 
the chase was onpainting the tavern ceiling for an egg

the man sat in the tavern 
and ate black bread 
and sour pickles 

he asked the bartender for an egg
but the bartender would not give it to him
because he had no credit left on his tab

the man begged him for the egg
and demanded the egg
but still the bartender refused to give it to him 

the man looked at the ceiling and saw that it was speckled 
and told the bartender he would paint it for him 
if only he would give him one of the eggs 

the bartender called the owner of the tavern 
and explained the proposition 
and the owner agreed, reluctantly 

the man returned after less than an hour 
with a bucket of paint 
and he painted the ceiling 

and when he finished the job 
the bartender gave him the egg 
and the man ate the egg 

the bartender asked the man about his proposition 
the bartender said that the paint alone would cost more than an entire carton of eggs 
the bartender asked why the man didn't just sell the bucket of paint and buy himself a carton of eggs

the man said to the bartender 
that if had the foresight and the wisdom to know that he could sell the paint for the eggs 
he would have done so 

but he didn't have the foresight or the wisdom 
the man explained that he was a thoroughbred fool 
and he was not ashamed of that in the slightest 

the man thanked the bartender for the advice 
and he thanked him for the egg 
and he took his paint can and went on his way sitting at my desk

yesterday I sat at my desk 
and read my book 
and wrote down some thoughts as I went along

in this moment I am remembering that
and wishing that today I had as well  
but there was not enough time 

I am thinking of tomorrow 
and I can foresee having some time to sit at my desk 
and read my book and write some thoughts as I go 

in fact 
it is occurring to me now
that I should cancel my plans tomorrow 

and spend the entire day 
sitting at my desk
and 

reading my book
and writing some thoughts 
as I go 
the bottle of water

the label on the water bottle had been ripped off
it sat there on the corner of the table
someone had drank most of it

I didn't think much of it
I hardly noticed it 
until it exploded and flew across the room 

there was no one else there except me
I was scared as hell 
I walked towards the bottle 

there was no string attached to it
the cap was long gone
and the water poured on to the ground 

I remembered in that moment 
a time when I was walking through the grass 
and I saw something strange as well 

there was a miniature evergreen tree
growing in the field 
it was no taller than the grass that surrounded it 

I watched it for a long time 
and eventually it was struck by lighting 
and started the smallest forest fire I'd ever seen 

it didn't spread much
and after the smoke dissipated
the remnants of the fire looked like a cow patty 

it took me a moment to realize 
why I was reminded of the fire 
when I saw the bottle explode 

but eventually it occurred to me 
that I would have used that left over water 
to put out the grass fire 

it both those things had happened
in the same place
on the same day the movie

I was very happy to go to the movies tonight 
it was a great show 

I considered buying a popcorn before the trailers started 
but in the end I held off 

because we brought our own snacks
and our own drinks 

it is better not to spend that much money 
if you don't have to a great lamp 

there was a lamp 
that I recently put onto my desk again 
and I will say
that it's a great lamp

it uses a weird lightbulb 
that hasn't busted for eleven years 
I hope that I never have to change it 
ever

it is a great lamp to put overtop of your notebook 
while you are writing something down 
or to have over
the book you are reading 

I hope that anyone who wants a good lamp 
for their desk
is able to get one 
that they like 

I will hope to have this lamp 
for a long time 
I hope this is the only lamp I ever need
for the rest of my life 



the shark 

a three hundred foot shark fin 
emerged from the concrete 
and cut through the city 

there was no earthquake 
it was more like a chef's knife 
slicing through raw tuna

the fin emerged from the concrete 
and slid through the downtown of the city 
and then it slowly lowered and disappeared 

it faded in and out 
like a sickle moon 
passing through nighttime  

there were people that went missing that day 
just over a hundred 
it took a few hours to realize what had happened 

but eventually the transit commission 
noticed they were missing one of their subway cars 
they counted, and triple counted and counted again 

likely what happened is the shark ate the subway car
no one wants to admit it 
but we all know that it's true 
new home 

it is strange to see an empty skyline
there are only three buildings 
and two blurry billboards 

I am used to seeing many buildings
none of them ever had any discernible purpose
they were just cardboard cutouts, glorified rectangles

there is snow on the roof next door
some of it has melted since this morning 
and two days ago there was no snow there at all 

it seems people live close to one another in order to share resources
I don't know if squirrels do that also 
I don't know where they go at the end of the day 
there are three friends

there are three friends 

the dolphin
the salamander 
the mammoth 

they hang out together a couple times a week
they drink coffee and sit on a park bench 

they sit out in the cold 
and they sit out in the heat 

they talk shit 
and never talk about anything sentimental 

they are known as the guys on the park bench
and if anyone else ever sits there 

when they want to sit there 
there is hell to pay 

the guys on the park bench 
are killers

they murder people 
and eat them 

they eat their flesh 
raw

they don't salt it 
and they eat it to the bone 

I would never sit on their park bench 
I wouldn't go near it 

because 
I don't want to die the jar 

I bought a glass jar at the store
for two dollars

I will use it to put my coffee grinds in 
when I make my coffee in my new office 

that way I don't have to go all the way to the kitchen 
and there won't be flies circling the garbage can in the office

I'm looking forward to making my coffee tomorrow 
and dumping the grinds in the jar

I will leave them there 
and add more grinds into the jar 

day after day 
until it is almost full

and then I will take the grinds 
and dump them into the compost

I will then wash out the jar 
and make more coffee

day after day
until it is full again wedding

I ended up playing video games for three hours this evening 
it was difficult to focus on my work 
because tomorrow I am getting married 

originally we were going to get married in the spring 
but last week we decided
we would tie the knot tomorrow 

it will mark our third year anniversary 
three years ago tomorrow we ordered chinese takeout 
and she spent the night a hypothetical treadmill and a hypothetical cat hammock 

we are considering the idea of buying a treadmill 
and putting it by the window 
by the cat hammock 
that we ordered online 
it should arrive at the house in the next few days 

we will see how the cat hammock looks first
and how often our cat sits in it 
I have a feeling he will like it quite a bit 
I have a feeling he will sit there in the afternoon 
when the squirrels will run across the power lines cat

my cat sleeps 
in the chair beside me 
and I am careful not to disturb him 

there are few things as peaceful 
as seeing him rest 
tucked into a little ball 

the only thing I would recommend to anyone 
to do 
in their life 

is to find a pet cat
to take care of 
and pay attention to them 

I don't know what else there is 
that really
means as much sentimental garbage

there was a blue clay pot in the basement 
my wife had inscribed her name into the bottom of it 
when she made it 
when she was ten or twelve or so 

she thought it was garbage 
but I wanted to keep it 
and use it as a pencil holder 
on my desk 

I would say 
it's good to have 
some 
sentimental garbageracoon piss

to write a love letter to someone 
and explain to them that you feel strongly about them 
can illicit a response that could cause an issue 

it if is true 
they may be overwhelmed 
and swelling with the feeling 

it may become out of control 
and burst the windows in their house
and snap down their front door 

it is dangerous to tell someone you love them 
it may destroy their house 
and cause them a lost of money in repairs 

on the other hand 
if you do love them 
and you do not tell them 

you may cause damage to your own home
withholding that kind of information 
can be catastrophic 

the sinks could burst 
the insulation may catch fire 
raccoon's may nest in your ceiling 

I once knew a guy 
who had raccoons living in his ceiling 
their piss dripped onto his sister when she was sleeping 

and eventually the drywall gave out 
and they fell onto her 
when she was working in her room 

he told me about it at work 
and I laughed when he told me
but he didn't find it funny at all 

he was too shy to tell the girl he liked
how he felt 
and that's what happened to him 

he was a good man 
and I hope things have been going okay for him 
lately earwax candle

I have spent the last few weeks making a candle from my earwax 
I plan to light it tomorrow morning when I wake up

I don't know why I made the candle
or why I chose tomorrow as the day to light it

I don't know what kind of odour it will fill the house with 
perhaps none at all 

I am worried that my wife and her mother 
will become angry when they realize what I've been up to all of this time 

I hope things will turn out okay 
I hope they will think it's an acceptable candle 
alleyway squid 

there was a squid stuffed in the trash can 
its tentacles hung around the edge 

it was there overnight
and in the morning the alleyway stunk irreconcilably

a woman came out of the bakery 
holding a barbecue lighter

she stuffed it into the squids head 
and tried to light it

but her plan failed 
and she broke her barbecue lighter 

a woman came from the deli
and tried to bag the squid 

but it was too slippery 
and she ended up tearing the bag 

the women stood there 
frustrated as hell

they wanted the squid out of there
they made a new plan 

they came back with 
supplies 

one of them dragged her axe 
while the other knotted a rope 

they tied the rope to the trash can
and angled it around a pulley system 

that wrapped around a street lamp 
and a dumpster 

they counted down 
and on three 

the woman swung the axe
and severed the rope

the squid flew through the air 
almost two city blocks 

as far as they were concerned 
it was long gone 

the squid was someone else's problem 
now

the power bar

what has become 
of the items 

plugged into the power bar
the ones that required electricity 

their chords have been severed at the plug
and they are gone 

it happened after the sky 
became yellow and orange and pink and then black 

it was like someone had wrapped the earth 
in a trash bag 

we could not see anything
if not for the little holes in the trash bag

where the sun poked through 
I'm not sure if they were there on purpose or if it was just an old bag

still there was not enough light to see
who stole the electronics 

but I am confident 
in my accusation 

that whoever wrapped the earth in a bag
was the one who stole all of the electronics 

I will admit 
it was a clever heist the salt king

the salt king 
is a store in our new neighbourhood 

a man creates salt there 
and he sells it in many varieties 

but mostly he sells salt licks
that's what keeps him in business 

he wears his winter jacket 
and worn out gloves

and he drags the salt around the shop
reorganizing everything constantly 

online there is surveillance footage 
of a guy trying to rob his store 

and the salt king tossed a Himalayan salt tower at the crook
and busted his head open

I love watching that video
he showed that guy not to mess with him again


two door stops 

the salamander's dream 
was of swimming in a pickle jar 

and narrowly escaping 
the demise of the bread slicer 

to interpret the dream of a salamander 
is an honour 

to consider the pickle jar 
and the bread slicer 

is a thrill 
I do not take for granted 

I was happy to buy a package of 
two door stops 

at some point last year 
and still I use them 

every single 
day 
wind misery 

there was wind all day 
outside
we made a soup and sandwiches for dinner

and played cards
while we ate
and I cleaned the dishes afterward 

I am a thirty four year old man 
who lives with his wife 
and his mother in law and two cats and one dog 

today I wrote my stories all day long 
and scribbled things into my notebooks 
and avoided the messages waiting for me on my cell phone 

tomorrow I will wake up 
and make my coffee
and begin writing again 

and in between we will eat our breakfast
and our lunch 
and our dinner 

I do not know where my misery has gone to 
it may have fallen out of my pocket and into the street
or perhaps it went off with the wind the blanket rock hero 

another crustacean in the atmosphere
another crustacean looks into the dust bowl 
where the lamp is 

where the blanket falls from the sky 
on one end of the earth
and a rock falls from the sky on the other 

in another dimension 
the rock was a hero
the blanket was its cape 

the rock flew 
the rock ended crime 
the rock saved lives 

it will take some time for the rock to find the blanket again 
but it will
and it will fly around and be a hero again 

the rock will fly towards the crustacean 
who is evil 
and it will put the crustacean in jail 

this is the plot of the movie I will require money for 
I will require millions of dollars to make this movie 
for justice the cloud's fault

there was ice in the park 
where the people were walking 
and one of the guys slipped 
and busted his head open 

the ambulance came 
and slipped as well 
and busted their heads open 
so more ambulances came

the next ambulances 
couldn't stop 
and they slipped down the hill
on the ice

and they crashed into each other
and exploded 
and then another ambulance came 
and saved everyone

including the first guy 
who slipped 
it was unclear 
if it was his fault that everyone got hurt 

or if was the cloud's fault 
the cloud 
that dumped down all of the ice 
in the first place
the way the floor looks

the clam shells 
have fallen down the staircase

they have clattered 
like snappy shoes 

they have broken into pieces 
and there is sand in them 

their salt has 
gone inside of the hardwood

it is there forever
there is no baking soda solution for itnew socks 

the philanthropist
had eaten a lit candle 
and choked on the wick 

he did not think he would die 
but lo and behold 
he is dead 

the intent of his will was clear
his money was to be withdrawn 
and to be put into the garbage chute immediately 

no one wanted to throw his money into the garbage 
they wanted to keep it for themselves 
and buy new socks 

new socks
that were free 
from holes revenge of the sith 

filling the glass cup 
with tap water 

and putting it on my desk 

taking a sip every now and again 

as I spend time in my word processor 
and consider what I have written 

I am sitting in my chair 

trying to remember where the day began the legend of the orange peel 

the legend of the orange peel 
was crystallized 
when an box of envelopes was found floating 
inside of a cloud 

the envelopes were examined
and they were never used 
it was decided that they were bought last year 
and were still perfectly fine 

but no one could ever use those envelopes
not when they were found floating inside of that cloud
not when they were the lynchpin 
that crystallized the legend of the orange peel the box 

a line 
floats in the center of the room 

like someone has drawn it with a pencil 
it hangs in the air 

I threw a box on it 
and now the box floats on the line 

I do not know what the point of the line is 
but I am glad to have found a use for that box

it was just this box that was sitting in the hall for a long time 
and for some reason I didn't want to toss it out toast crust 

toast crust 
goes onto the plate 

they are crumbs 
they are the crumbs 

they are the best crumbs of all time 
they were from peanut butter and jam toast 

they were left over from an afternoon snack
that someone had with a hot cup of coffee 

the plate is on the table 
pb&j smeared on it and crumbs sprinkled around the corner of the plate  
the applewood crisp is never deleted 

I sat down originally and wrote the line -- the applewood crisp was a small chip like creature 
and then I deleted it and now I have written it out again 

I am thinking of the applewood crisp 
I am thinking of its relevance 

it is something like a wood chip and a potato chip
it lives in the woods 

it has small eyes and jumps off trees 
and glides around 

it does not eat
but it drinks raindrops when they are available 

the applewood crisp does not sleep
and its moods fluctuate often 

they are not complex moods 
but they are strongly felt 

the applewood crisp often stands on a tree branch 
and looks out into the horizon 

and considers the options of the world 
but most of all 

the applewood crisp 
is never deleted 

and even if it is 
it finds a way back the poodle from faust

I sometimes wonder 
what I am scared of
when it comes to sharing my writing 

I think that I think 
I'm scared of what people think 
but I'm actually not 

I made a new website 
http://www.joshuahillelbarsky.com 
and everything is there 

but now 
what should I do with such a thing ?
I will continue to add things to it 

and each time I write here 
it will also go there 
so this page will go there too 

and when I write about watermelon seeds
and fire 
and dirt 

it will all go there 
it will go under my name 
which I have realized is satanic in a way 

my first name has six letters
my middle name has six letters
my last name has six letters 

perhaps I am not the devil 
but I am more like the poodle 
from faust Michael the minnow and his friend 

in the middle of the ocean 
there was a square of waves 

each wave moved in unison 
towards the centre of the square 

and when the waves reached the middle of the square 
a new wave began again 

there was only one person who had ever seen this 
it was a minnow 

the minnow was named Michael 
he was a good man 

when he saw this for the first time 
he did not know what to think 

he did not know if he should tell the other minnows 
he did not even know if he should tell himself 

that was the severity of his denial 
he did not know if he should even tell himself 

and that is what he said to his friend 
he said that he couldn't believe it 

and his friend did not understand what he meant 
his friend only thought that Michael saw a wave 

and seeing a wave was nothing inordinacy 
seeing a wave was insignificant 

but when Michael showed his friend the square of waves 
his friend said 

ok Michael 
this is not just any wave 

this is something great
this is a great wave 

thank you for showing me this 
and they stared at the wave for a long time 

they each considered the severity of their denial 
and the simultaneous awe that they felt 

they couldn't express it well but they both felt it 
in their own way a rice cake spins in the sky 

as I was writing in my new book in the morning 
I thought of a pattern in my life that has to do with me leaving 

the schools I went to
the jobs I've had, home 

I can see that I prefer a certain amount of space for myself 
it is difficult to know if I made the right choice in any of those scenarios 

but if I am honest 
I can't go back and say I didn't do what I thought was right at the time 

and the truth is where I have ended up 
is exactly where I want to be 

I am looking forward to working on my new book again tomorrow 
I am looking forward to waking up and getting dressed and returning to my desk the hero of oakwood drive

the wart 
was a kid from oakwood drive 

he had no mouth 
instead he just had a wart on his face 

he climbed in the snow 
and looked for the neighbourhood's missing cats 

he didn't care so much about the families that lost their cats 
he more so cared about the cats not freezing to death 

or starving 
or getting eaten by the coyotes 

today when we were walking 
we saw the wart holding an orange cat 

the cat kicked and bit at the wart's arm 
but he didn't flinch

a man ran out of his house 
screaming 

he thought that the wart was planning to kill 
the cat

but that man slipped on the ice 
and fell on his ass 

the wart gave him the middle finger 
and took the cat up the road

to 31 oakwood drive
and returned the cat to his home 

in the window of 31 oakwood drive 
you can see that orange cat 

sleeping by the fireplace 
on a little pillow 

I would say that the wart 
is undoubtably 

the hero 
of oakwood drivecrushed ice 

I would like to slow my thoughts down enough to think them 
at the moment they are similar to the ice machine in the fridge door
the crushed setting 

even with a mug where it's supposed to be 
a bit of that ice will end up on the ground 
and in this case those are the most important thoughts 

I know it might be strange or irrelevant 
to think of the ice in such a way 
but it is true in this moment that my thoughts have become shredded ice 

I will have to get the snow shovel
and scoop my brain 
and toss it into the neighbour's yard fruit snacks 

I would like to invent a fireplace on wheels 
I would like to invent a fire that floats around and follows me wherever I go

for now all I have is some fruit snacks 
that I'm keeping in my pocket 

they taste like real fruit
they are tropical the triangle guy 

I had forgot to mention 
that there was an old blank envelope on my desk

and one day I drew a triangle on it 
and then I drew a small happy face inside of the triangle 

and then I gave it two small legs 
it didn't really need arms 

some days I notice it's there 
but most often it just is 

sometimes when I am playing chess 
or taking a break from writing I look at the triangle character 

I love it 
it is a funny cartoon shovelling snow off the roof 

an old woman's head 
fell off of the roof 
and landed in the snow 

I climbed up there 
and looked for her body 
but I didn't find it 

we shovelled all the snow 
off the roof 
and we did not find any clues 

whoever cut her head off 
probably booted it from the street 
and got it lost up there 

maybe a squirrel was messing with it 
and that's what knocked it down 
other than that I really have no idea how it could have happened 

I'm not sure what happened to her head 
I had left it on the ground when I was shovelling the snow off the roof 
and when I came back it was gone unpredictable fate 

I was filling my cup with ice 
in the fridge door 
and something strange happened 

I noticed a small fish inside of one of the ice cubes 
I left him thaw in the cup and added some water
he was alive and seemed okay

I pulled the fridge from the wall
and I looked at the water line 
and I followed it through the wall 

and then I became lost 
in insulation 
fibreglass 

and then in a moment 
I awoke 
and I was trapped in a sandbag 

I did not realize that fibreglass insulation 
was the equivalent to fridge door ice 
I suppose it's true that our fates can be very unpredictable the plane crash memorial

ceramic 
iguana skin 
bowls 

on the side of the road 
in a cardboard box 
a plane 

crashed into the box 
and almost two hundred people 
died 

the question that was asked 
was how the people died 
and the answer 

was that they crashed into the box
that was full of the ceramic 
iguana skin bowls 

the bowls now 
serve as a memorial 
for the people who died 

or 
is it just that nobody really wanted 
those bowls 

not the garbage man 
or the neighbours 
or anyone 

either way 
they're there 
if you need new bowls you can take them the nap

I ended up napping in my chair 
while I was reading 

the lasagna noodle remained in the box 
in the cupboard 

the roof of the house 
was still 

and there was a squirrel who jumped along a power line 
and was electrocuted 

he did not die 
he lived to see another day 

when I wake up from this nap 
I will toss a lasagna noodle onto the roof 

for the squirrel 
to have editing 

reading over one of my stories 
I became filled with self doubt 

I caught a thought that said 
maybe I am just not good at this 

and maybe I'm not that good at it 
but I keep trying 

I'll get this story into shape 
I don't need to love it 

but I'll get it done 
one way or another computer keyboards in the snow 

there was one computer keyboard 
on the road 

and another one
that stuck out of a mound of snow 

when school let up for the day 
all of the kids ran to the sidewalk 

one guy took the keyboard from the road 
and threw it in the air like a bone 

it smashed on the ground 
and his buddy jumped onto it like it was a skateboard 

he slid on it 
down the hill 

his friends laughed
and the other keyboard remained in the snowbank 

it froze into place overnight 
and in the morning another kid saw it

he kicked it 
and it snapped in half 

half of it went into the middle of the road
and the other half remained frozen in the snowbank 

soon
a car drove by and ran over the half that was in the middle of the road  

one day the snow will melt and the half that was frozen in the snow bank 
will return the death of the lasagna slipper

I used to know a guy that used lasagna noodles as slippers 
he used an elastic band to keep them on his feet
he would crunch along and get the morning paper from the sidewalk 

he's dead now 
he was having a heart attack
and then fell into an elevator shaft

I was getting a donut when I heard he was dead
my friend called me 
and told me 

the truth was I didn't feel much when I heard 
sometimes people die and it doesn't really hit me that hard
it's just what happened 

but I think about that guy a lot 
and his lasagna slippers
and how once I saw a stray dog try to bite him 

he tried to kick the dog 
and his lasagna slipper went helicoptering down the street
I laughed my ass off at that computer game 

I have become addicted
somewhat
to a computer game

this happens every once in a while 
I never see it coming 
but somehow I get hooked 

this game that I'm looped in on now
you have to make an army 
to destroy the other guy's tower

you play people from around the world 
and I never get sick of it
I keep wanting to play every day 

my new strategy 
has been to only build what I need 
and then defend it with everything I have 

I'll say
that it's working really well 
and I'm winning tons of battles 

I suppose I live my life similarly 
trying to get only what I need 
and then trying to keep it 

I'd say 
it's going well 
for now 
I stand accused

I stand accused by my wife  
of writing repetitively  
about certain images

one, she says, is that there is always some kind of string 
or some kind of power chord 
like the tail of a toaster 

and then there are reptiles 
a lizard, an iguana 
or a snail 

and lastly, she says, 
there usually are some kind of inanimate objects 
broken ones

I think I know what she means 
I stand accused 
and am okay with it  the fly who lives in the snow

I am thinking of the fly who lives in the snow 

he lights a small fire and sits beside it 

he lives in the yard 

there is frost on his eyelashes and his moustache 

and it is too cold to fly 

he wears a jacket made of goose feathers 

he cut two holes in the back of it for his wings to stick out 

each evening he listens to the radio 

and when his favourite song comes on 

he does a dance 

recently he has made soup

from a frozen plum 

it keeps him going 

especially on the really cold days a bag of microwave popcorn on its head

there was a fox who ran down the street
with a bag of microwave popcorn on its head

and a mile away 
the vitamin store was on fire 

there were many vitamins 
inside of that store 

and someone had lit the store on fire 
and now the vitamins got all burnt up 

it was sad for the people 
who wanted to have the vitamins 

and now the vitamin store 
was just a pile of ash 

but that is when a clue was found 
the microwave popcorn 

on the fox's head 
who microwaved it? 

the guy who worked at the vitamin store did
and then the fox stole the popcorn from him 

and then the microwave exploded
and burned the whole place down 

the fox would enjoy the popcorn later 
when he got home 

he would put on a dvd
kick back on the couch 

and watch
the show our toilet

I realized a swordfish was in our toilet 
I thought someone left the toilet bowl scrubber in there 
but it was a swordfish 

it was still alive 
I tossed it in the bathroom and tried to save its life 
but the bastard stabbed me in the eye 

I'm in the hospital now 
and that swordfish is back home in the tub 
probably swimming around like he runs the place 

when I get home I'm going to toss that swordfish out of the window
into the snow 
or I'll sell it online 

I could probably get a hundred bucks for that thing 
I hope I'm not permanently 
blinded the laser beam

a laser beam 
went onto a zucchini 
and exploded it 

the apartment building that it happened in 
was a bit old 
but people liked living there 

it was in a good area of town 
and there was a nice grocery store 
close by 

when the zucchini exploded the news trucks came
and they all wanted a piece of the action 
the story was on every channel that night 

a lot of the residents watched it 
and it was exciting for them
to see their apartment building on tv 

but some of them missed it
in fact they didn't even know the news trucks were there
and they didn't even know the zucchini got exploded by the laser beam 

but luckily one of the residents recorded the news footage off of the tv 
and made a couple copies of the tape 
and was willing to lend it out to anyone who missed it 

most everyone has seen it now 
and while things have mostly returned to normal 
they will always remember the time that the laser beam exploded the zucchini state of the union

it may be true that I haven't left the house in two days 
I have barely left the room 
except to go downstairs for supper 
and to go the bedroom to sleep 

it may sound like torture 
or that I am snowed in somewhere 
but I would say that things are great 
perhaps better than ever in my life 

this weekend I will go to the grocery store 
I will go to the library to pick up some dvd's I put on hold
and I will return the ones that are due 
and then I will come back home and drink my coffee and work on my bookshaircut 

a few days ago I felt like having a haircut
but then I changed my mind 
and I decided that I won't get my hair cut for a while

sometimes it's good to have messy hair 
even if you're a bald guy like me 
and have fuzzy hair around your ears

eventually my wife will draw the line
she will say it's time to have a haircut 
I will try to listen to her for the most part 

I would suggest if you're a bald guy like me 
get a wife if you can
so you know when it's time to cut your hair 

and if not 
then grow your hair as long as you want
I don't care laser pointer

it is true that there could be a sniper on the rooftop 
if there was I would toss a rock at him 
and if I missed 
I would throw some old compost on the roof 
so that the raccoons would eat his feet

that is if the sniper was after me 
if he was at some random guy I never met 
I'm not sure what I would do 
perhaps I would call the cops 
before taking matters into my own hands 

I was sitting in my usual chair 
reading a book 
and that's when I saw a red dot 
but then I realized it was my cat 
playing with his laser 

and that's when I realized what I would do if there was a sniper 
on the roof 
I would point my cat's laser pointer at him 
and then my cat would jump over there
and eat his head off 

consider that 
the next time 
someone puts a price on my head
consider that 
the next time you hire an assassin to take me outNeptune again 

the dog tooth 
floated into the sky 
into outer space 
and towards Neptune 

there was a robot on Neptune 
who saw the dog tooth 
and the robot took a photo of the dog tooth 
and sent the photo to a crater in the ground 

the crater looked at the dog tooth photo
and had no idea what it was 
and the dog tooth did not know what the crater was
and the dog tooth did not know why the robot took a photo of it 

and then the dog tooth went into the crater
and exploded the entire planet 
and Neptune was destroyed 
it was just crumbs floating with the dog tooth 

the robot was sad that the planet was destroyed 
but it took some of the crumbs 
and began to build 
Neptune again oedipus forest 

the plants 
were in the back seat of the car

and there was no one driving the car
just a cement block strapped to the steering wheel 

the car ended up hitting a blockhead
a guy with a serious oedipus complex 

when the police came and looked at the car
they saw the plants and they did not know why they were there 

one of the cops knew the blockhead
and said to their partner that he had a serious oedipus complex

it began to rain a lot 
and the streets became flooded

the blockhead was washed away
down into the valley 

and the car parts also ended up all over the place
and most of the police drowned in the water

but the plants were fine
they were unharmed 

and they grew to be very tall 
and that is why there is a forest here today oatmeal bowl

I am facing somewhat of a sadness
from exhaustion 
and there are many sparkling water cans in the trash 

it is strange to be under the stamp 
to be an ink pad 
and the walls of the room become smaller 

but I did make a massive pot of beet soup
and drove the car through a big storm 
and got some decent writing done 

I will drink my water now 
and forget my thoughts
for the most part 

I will have to wash my oatmeal bowl tomorrow 
I forgot to
today 

but it is good to have somewhat of a sadness 
some of the time
I don't mind it that muchthe stairwell fire

there was gasoline in the mop bucket
and someone tossed a match in it 
and then the mop bucket fell down the stairs 

it was strange to see the flames splashing around like that 
the fire burned
on the concrete 

an ant came in from under the door 
and climbed up the stairs 
avoiding the gasoline 

the ant then went on the fire alarm 
and thought of pulling it 
but then didn't feel like it 

since the sound would be so loud 
and the fire was mostly burned out 
anyway 

the ant then turned on his 
mp3 player 
and listened to some new songs he had downloaded chew the gum until the flavour is gone

it is strange to face a sadness 
that has no clear explanation for being 

I would not say that I am facing a depression 
but rather an ongoing exhaustion that has no clear explanation for being 

often the way through 
is identifying a clear explanation for being 

but that is easier said than done 
obviously 

I found a container in my room 
with some grape flavoured gum 

I think it is grape flavoured 
and I would say that it is quite good

I will continue to chew the gum until the flavour is gone 
and then I will spit it out into the garbage 

perhaps it is helpful to find joy in a distraction 
or perhaps it is not good to procrastinate the clear explanation for being 

I fluctuate between the two 
I'm sure you understand what I mean the flea on the horizon that looked onwards into the grass

the flea on the horizon that looked onwards into the grass
and he went on his computer and was trying to save his file 

but something was strange 
and it wasn't working properly 

he sat in the grass and began to scream
because all of his work was not saved 

and then another flea came over
and asked him what was wrong 

he had a hard time explaining 
because he was so upset 

but the other flea was very patient and listened to him 
and eventually went on the computer with him 

they figured out what was going wrong with the file 
and found out where it was being saved 

he loved that flea for helping him
and he asked that flea to marry him 

and soon they will get married
on the horizon that looked onwards into the grassthey are dead in the clouds

a chicken wing bone 
has no purpose here 
in the trash 

instead 
it should be sent into a cloud
to float into another cloud 

the chicken wing bone 
was retrieved for only fifteen cents 
but still there is no reason for it to go in the trash 

the trash is a place for excellence 
the trash is a place for the greatest things in the world 
the trash is not chicken wing heaven 

when you think of the people who you know 
who have died
imagine that they are there with the chicken wing bone 

they are eternally looking at that chicken wing bone
and it is all they have 
since they are dead in the clouds if you notice crumbs beside your old phone

I have always wondered 
about the mouse that lives in the telephone 
he is very small and can go through the twirly chord 
and fit in through the receiver or the ear piece, whichever

he delivers strange messages 
to a lot of people around the world 
he is a hero to many 
but some people say he is just a ghost 

if you notice crumbs beside your old phone 
you cannot deny the truth 
and if you have a cell phone only 
you may never meet the man 

but those who know, know
that he is the one and only mouse 
who lives in the telephone 
and no one can stop him light spider

the light went through the glass and turned into the shape of a spider
I was looking at it on the table

it would be strange if there were spiders made of light
I would try to catch them in a glass

which is a common trap 
for a real spider 

what would happen then 
if there was a spider made of light 

and a light that was in the shape of a spider
on the same table 

I returned to my rice 
and thought of something else in that moment 

it was probably best not to keep thinking about light spiders 
for the sake of my sanity simultaneous war

I have faced some turmoil lately 
in my own way 

I will have to accept that it may always be there
in some form

perhaps the next time it arrives
I could remember that, and not feel so affected by it 

but that is the problem 
with turmoil 

is that it forces a person into a moment 
and traps them between two bean poles 

I want to offer peace to myself 
in those times 

it is difficult 
as I have the tendency to go to war simultaneously 

as my own ally 
and against myself the faint of heart 

a salamander went into a pita bun and fell asleep 
and then it woke up 
and went down the sidewalk 
under the sun 

and then the next day the salamander went into a hot dog bun 
and was very happy sleeping there
but when it woke up 
it was covered in mustard 

it ran through a tunnel in the snow 
into a storage container 
and this time there was no bread
just some crumbs 

the salamander went back towards the sun 
and tried to find that pita bun 
but it couldn't find it
so it went and found the hot dog bun again 

the hot dog bun was the best place for it to sleep 
and it stayed there for some time
but every night the bun became more stiff
and eventually it molded 

the life of the salamander is not for the faint of heart 
but with enough courage and a bit of luck 
the salamander will hope to find another piece of bread to sleep on 
one day a cardboard box 

I used to care about cardboard boxes 
a lot more than I do now 

I once imagined one getting booted 
and floating towards the sky 

and a bird would get caught in the box 
and then fall down towards the grass

people wondered why there is a bird inside the cardboard box 
people wondered who ordered the bird online and left it in the field 

I would say that I still care about cardboard boxes 
even though every morning when I wake up 

I go outside and boot one up into the sky 
to see if I can hit a cloud 

recently I accidentally kicked a pineapple 
thinking it was a cardboard box 

and that hurt my toe badly 
and ended up going into some guy's windshield 

I had to run for ten minutes with a damn stubbed toe 
before I lost him 

if I see that guy again 
I'm going to give him the middle finger 

but if you see a bird in a field 
try to give it a helping hand 

it may have gotten stuck inside
a cardboard box I will try to leave dog food out for them in the yard and refill their water bowls every couple of days 

I have been having a better week 
writing my book
this week 
than last 

this time last week
I was reminded of being a child
and ramming my head into the wall
from a sheer frustration of being 

but this week 
I have found the confidence 
that I can stick the landing 
and get to the end 

sometimes
I think that it is all for nothing 
and it has all been a waste of time 
and a complete failure 

it seems as though these thoughts 
have a way of cornering me 
at times
and it can be very difficult to get out from under them 

perhaps I should come to terms 
with the fact that they may always be lingering 
and I may never really be free of them 
maybe by allowing them in, I can keep them under control 

the denial of them 
the thought that I can beat them 
and leave them behind for good 
may not be the best strategy 

I will try to leave dog food out for them 
in the yard 
and refill their water bowls 
every couple of days 
nose hill 

some people have found a strange place 
called the nose hill 

they walk there 
and look out into the yellow grass 

and they look at the city 
and the puddles

they park their cars at the bottom there
and then they walk all the way up to the top 

it can be very windy some days
and sometimes dogs run very fast there 

it was strange to have seen a pair of scissors poking out from the ground 
some guy picked them up and put them in the garbage can so nobody stepped on them 

especially so that the dogs didn't 
even if they needed to have their toe nails clipped the cheese tavern hero

the mice have gone to the cheese tavern 
to nibble on a snack 
and listen to the band 

one of the mice brought in the crumbs from a bag of dog food they found in the garbage
and they put it in the deep fryer 
and made dog food fries 

all of the mice loved the fries 
and they had a great time 
and the mouse that brought in the dog food crumbs 

was the cheese tavern hero 
he was high on the glory 
and he would always remember that night the ocean side barbecue restaurant 

a squid had strolled up to the bucket of crabs
and looked inside
he nocked over the bucket 
and all the crabs became free 

they ran back towards the water
the chef saw what happened 
and he was deeply angry at the squid for doing that
he took him and slammed him down onto the cutting board

he took his clever and sliced the squid in two 
and severed his tentacles 
he covered them with oil 
and then tossed them onto the grill 

as the squid looked onward
at the water 
he saw all of the crabs scrambling into the sand 
towards their freedom 

and he knew that he had done what he could 
but his fate was sealed regardless 
it was written on the chalk board, he was the daily special 
at the ocean side barbecue restaurant  the mousetrap and the strange goo were there with the green onion 

there is a strange goo floating in space
and a mousetrap has began to orbit it 

an explosion in the distance caused the mousetrap to touch the goo
and snap onto it

and then a portal was created
between two dimensions 

the roots of a green onion grew through the portal 
and then the green onion floated past

behind it were some other green onions 
that were tied together with a purple elastic

they were on sale 
they were twenty five cents off 

the whole bunch cost only ninety cents 
and here they were 

travelling through the dimensions 
and the song from the grocery store played 

a song that many people knew 
and loved 

the mousetrap and the strange goo 
were there

with the green onion 
and the void of other the dimension 

that did nothing 
it was slightly opaque at best a curious worm 

a curious worm 
poked its head from the mud 
and went towards the road 

to eat a jellybean that he saw
but the sun arrived
and dried him out into a crisp 

such hedonism 
said the sun 
must not go unpunished 

the sun showed no mercy to any worm
and he was no exception
the sun hated all worms 

there was a worm 
who heard about the death of the jellybean worm 
he got in his truck and went towards the roadside diner 

and he blared his windshield wiper fluid
even though his windshield wasn't dirty 
because he loved how it made it look like it was raining 

and he went to the diner 
and sat at the booth 
and ate a hamburger 

and he met his buddy out back
who sold him a shotgun 
he was going to take the shotgun and get on a rocket ship

and go to the sun and destroy it
for all the worms that it killed
especially the one who was just trying to get a jellybean from the road the treasure box 

I forgot about the treasure box I found 
in the sand 
yesterday

it took me a long time to open it 
I almost got so bored 
that I was going to leave it there

but I dragged it up to a cliff 
and pushed it off
and sent it plummeting down so the damn thing exploded

that's what was inside
a bunch of dynamite 
no money, no gold, no nothing 

just a box full of dynamite 
that exploded in the sand 
it was good for nothing the cove and the open road 

a truck has backed up and made a loud noise 
and went into the cove

it backed up into the starfish wall 
and sent all the starfish falling down into the water 

the starfish were pissed at the truck for crashing into them 
and they went onto the truck and stuck on it 

when the truck drove down the highway 
it was strange that there were so many starfish on it 

eventually the driver went and had a bite to eat at some roadside place
and when he back came out he saw them there 

he went to the carwash and tried to get them off 
but it only made them stick even more

he saw it as vandalism at first and he understood their revenge
but now he has realized that his truck is a collector's item

and is the only truck that has starfish 
stuck to the side of it 

the starfish too have learned to love
being out on the open road
the kid on the screen running towards the snow 

sitting in the movie theatre
there was a kid on the screen running around in the snow 

I was wondering what they were showing him for
and there was no real answer 

he was just a kid 
in the snow 

running around 
trying to escape and get to the road 

but his mom went after him 
and caught him before he took off forever

he wasn't even wearing a jacket
just a sweater

but it looked like it was pretty nice out 
so he'd be alright

the credits rolled and the mom and the kid cleared the frame
and it showed the snow on the horizon 

the kid was probably wondering what was out there
that much I understood reading I

I would recommend 
sitting and reading a book 
to anyone 
at this point 

sometimes
even if you don't know what the words are saying 
it is just enough 
to sit and hold the book in your hands

my whole life 
I wished I was a better reader 
but no matter if I read all day, every day 
I bet the feeling would remain 

I will do my best to read again tomorrow 
and the next day 
and the day 
after that 

and to you, 
if I may suggest 
perhaps put down the crack pipe
turn off the cell phone 

sit on the couch
or wherever 
and take the time 
to look at the words on the pagereading II 

I have been reading for so many hours
my face feels like it is flaming

the book is almost finished
and I will be sad when it is over

I am already on the search for the next one 
but for now, I must sleep, or I will pass out on the ground

from a reading overdose 
which is lethal, in some cases 

there are worse ways to go 
than death by reading 

but then I would never know 
how the book ends reading III 

I will admit 
that I did not have time to get any reading done today 

by the time I finished giving my lecture 
and my taxes and got my writing done 

and ate my supper 
there wasn't any time left 

I will say that I feel worse 
having not read at all 

than having almost overdosed on reading 
like yesterday 

but that is the way it goes
some days 

there are less than one hundred pages left in my book 
and I am eager to know what happens 

but tomorrow I have to give two lectures 
and go to one meeting 

and still get my writing done
so it is likely that I will not have time to read tomorrow

but I have hope for Thursday 
and Friday 

and Saturday 
and Sunday 

by then 
I think I will have finished reading my book reading IV (many more warts)

I did not expect this to happen 
but I ended up reading one chapter this evening 
with my sneakers hanging over the arm 
of the couch 

I didn't retain much 
but I got the general idea of what happened 
at least my eyes moved across the page
at least I saw the words 

if that is the best I can get
then I'll take it
–– say what you will about love
but I have my own saying 

it is better to have read
and lost 
than to never have read 
at all 

I am remembering a dream I had 
where I discovered a wart on the bottom of my foot 
I will remove my sock later this evening 
and ensure it was only a dream 

otherwise 
I will be transported 
back to the swimming pools
of my early youth 

where the warts ran rampant 
between the wading pool tiles 
and feet skin 
peeled off into the grout 

there were two pools I remember best
both close to our house
one was closer and less fun 
and the other one, the more fun one, was farther away 

it had more complicated slides,
a hot tub
and yes
more warts, many more warts reading V

the thought of finishing this book 
is cripplingly sad 

so much so that 
that now I don't even want to read it

because then the book will be over
and that gives me a sense of panic 

only two days ago...
I couldn't wait to finish the book 

but now 
things have changed 

it is as if I want to start the book again from scratch 
before I even finish it 

–– perhaps my mind is a smoke alarm 
with a low battery 

beeping incessantly 
like a bastard 

I remember once taking a broom stick  
and swinging it at one of those damn things in my old house 

sometimes you can push the button 
and it shuts off

and other times 
it doesn't work 

and you have to rip it off the wall 
and yank the battery out 

and smash it 
to bits

other times 
you do nothing 

and the entire place lights on fire
and burns to the ground 

perhaps 
my mind is a smoke alarm with a low battery 

and perhaps
it isn't reading VI (a suggestion for dillweed) 

I have no suggestions 
for dillweed 

unless there is something to be said for it 
that I’m unaware of 

there may be a certain feeling 
in my stomach 

that I would like to isolate
as a consistent 

and low level panic 
of sorts 

I know that there is one thing 
that will help 

it would be the time
to sit 

and read 
my book

perhaps then 
I may have a suggestion for dillweed

but until then 
I have none reading VII

I went to the book store and found three books 

the first one is fourteen hundred pages and cost six dollars
the second one is four hundred and fifty pages and also cost dix dollars
and the third one was also four hundred and fifty pages 
and cost four dollars 

I am already reading the second one, fifty pages in

when I woke up in the night 
at three in the morning 
I read it for one hour or so 
and then my wife came and told me to sleep again 

I read a few more chapters today 

and if I cannot sleep tonight
I will go back to my chair 
and I will read it 
again

I would like to visit the ocean again 
one of these days
I don't know when I will get the chance 
perhaps a lake will do 

when it becomes a bit warmer, for a vacation, I will bring my book to a lake provincial dirt

I went for a small walk 
yesterday 

and heard a strange squeaking in the tree
my wife said it was someone's piece of lawn furniture 

but I thought it was a bird 
and today when I was walking in the same spot 

I heard it again 
that same squeaking noise 

I looked up and I saw there was a bird's nest 
I could only see the bottom of it 

I looked up at the sky 
and I looked down to the dirt

the dirt here in Ontario 
is what it is 

it is not the Alberta dirt
that I know 

by my account 
the Alberta dirt is more ruthless

Ontario dirt
feels store bought 

I will try to make amends with the dirt here 
I will consider it on my walk tomorrow the imagination

the rice
went on the tape measurer 

and the wind turbine 
was spinning out of control 

still 
I was unbothered 

I was thinking my own thoughts 
even when the wind turbine spun off 

and flew into the sky and sliced a massive cloud in half 
and the tape measurer snapped shut and exploded the rice 

I didn't notice any of it
that's how zoned out I was 

and now 
I don't even remember what I was thinking about 

the imagination 
is a formidable beast 

I am lucky that I didn't get killed 
by the wind turbine or the tape measurer 

next time I will try to pay attention 
to what's going on 


half a dozen bagels

we were at the post office 
yesterday 

afterward we stopped at the bagel shop 
and bought half a dozen bagels 

I ate one yesterday
and two today 

my mom in law also ate one yesterday 
but I don't think she ate one today 

I was eating one while I was typing today 
and a sesame seed fell down onto the keyboard

it almost got trapped under the f key 
but I was able to fish it out, narrowly 

I just went downstairs and got another one and scarfed it down
and now there's only one left 

perhaps I will eat it for breakfast
and then I will go to the shop and get some more the fish goo sandal

the salamander eye 
floats towards the gefilte fish goo
inside of the jar 

it drops from the fridge
and goes onto a sandal 
and then stays there eternally 

each time 
someone puts on the sandal 
they are disgusted by the feeling of it 

it is cold and goopy 
and squishy 
and there is a salamander eye looking at the bottom of their foot

I am playing a computer game 
at the moment 
it is winding my thoughts into a strange spiral 

I am not sure it's a game 
that can be won 
but I know that it is a game to play while wearing a goo sandal 

consider it 
if you are playing a computer game
anytime soon the pickle sauce igloo

there was pickle sauce 
in the igloo 

it was inside of a strange glass orb 
next to a bumblebee skeleton and a horse's tooth 

some guy sat there 
wearing a magician's hat 

I asked him what the hell was going on
but he was dead 

so I left 
and eventually the igloo melted in the sun 

I realized then that the igloo
was made of the pickle sauce 

but it was too late
and the pickle sauce igloo was melted

and its creator
was dead before I even had the chance to meet the bastard 

for now I am still looking for the bumblebee skeleton 
and the horse's tooth 

only then 
will anyone have the slightest chance 

to know
what the hell is going on fermented snail ooze

curiously 
the moon has become a strange pizza slice 

a triangular shape 
that has taken the form of fermented snail ooze 

a handful of mothballs 
are thrown into the air and are mistaken by many as new stars 

it is strange how reflective mothballs are 
in the moonlight 

most people have no idea 
most people don't even have working eyeballs 

there is a lot to consider...
I will look forward to having a fresh cup of coffee in the morning 

and thinking more 
about it the pothole dream

there was a pothole in the road
that was full of rainwater

I was looking at it from the window 
it was distracting me from reading the chapter 

eventually I woke up
the sun was setting onto my face 

my cat was sleeping across from me 
I didn't know how long I was out

I realized I couldn't see the pothole from the window
and I was only dreaming I could 

when I walked to the car afterward 
I saw the pothole, just as I knew it to be 

I realized then how lucky I was
that I didn't lose my page during that nap 

I probably would have been pissed off
if I did the squid ink dream puff

the squid ink dream puff 
has seen the dog's face
and there is no turning back 

a kid with a banana 
stands on the shore
with his feet in the sand 

his dog is swimming in the water 
and has seen the squid ink dream puff 
and comes running back to him

he asks the dog 
what is going on 
and the dog barks 

the kid sees something out in the water
some doughy looking bun 
surrounded in the ink 

the kid goes into the water
and looks at it
he sees the plastic wrapped

it says, "squid ink dream puff" 
in pink letters
it looks like a great snack 

the dog barks again 
and tries to eat it 
but the kid tells the dog not to 

it isn't good 
for dogs 
to eat that kind of thing

there is a bird standing on the cliff 
the dog looks at the kid
until he tells him to go 

and then the dog bolts through the sand 
going after that bird
he is the fastest dog on earththe dollar store cheese grater

a dollar store cheese grater 
has fallen off a cliff 
and into the water 

the sun shines off the metal
and glares towards the beach 
like a distress signal 

some woman, who was tanning in her bathing suit saw it 
she thought it was a satanic message 
sent to her from hell 

she ran off her beach chair 
her sun hat went flying off 
her feet burned in the sand 

and worse on the asphalt 
when she ran through the parking lot 
she opened the trunk of her car and got her shotgun 

she ran back to the beach 
and she shot the cheese grater 
and it exploded 

she was out of breath 
and sun burnt 
and her feet were blistering

she went back to her beach chair 
and got back to tanning 
she was sad to have lost her hat

but at least there was no longer a dollar store cheese grater 
floating around 
in the water incremental progress

incremental progress
from a corn on the cob –– 

the husk has exploded 
and destroyed the axe that came towards it 

the axe is totalled 
by the power of the corn husk 

the metal is shattered 
and it is there in the field 

the shattered axe metal 
is dumb and infertile 

there will be no axe plant 
there will be no crop of axes to await 

because the corn knew
about incremental progress 

each kernel 
had the patience to grow 

they did not try to pop
and go into a movie theatre bag 

they are not into cheap thrills 
like that 

they are interested in kicking 
trascendental ass 

they are interested in being
great corn 

they are interested in 
incremental progressthe muffin's wrath

for many years 
the muffin has plotted its revenge 

against all of those 
who didn't buy it in the shop

or that thought it was a weird flavour 
or that bit it and spit it out 

and it seems as though 
as of today 

finally 
the muffin is ready to strike 

and I can assure you 
it isn't going to be pretty 

it's going to be really
bad

for everyone
including those who have already died

they will be lifted from their graves
and they will suffer even worse

for thinking they have escaped
the reckoning 

all of the ghosts will return to the earth 
to face the muffin's wrath 

even the unborn 
will became geriatric 

in their capacity 
to suffer 

I will say this 
for what it's worth 

get the ingredients 
make the dough 

fire up the oven 
and bake muffins FIVE HUNDRED

I have followed a piece of advice in this endeavour 
to be patient & persistent 

it has served me well 
and I am proud to note that I have now written in this book five hundred times 

I will say that from typing out these thoughts each day 
I have come to a single conclusion ––

it is better 
not to be perfectthe computer chip

the computer chip 
was there 

it was in a bag 
like salt & vinegar, and ketchup 

I was surprised to see it 
on the shelf at the grocery store 

it was even on sale 
fifty cents off 

and I put it into my cart 
and did the rest of my shopping

the cashier scanned it 
along with my carrots and onions 

I gave them my money
and they bagged it up

finally 
I had my own computer chip 

after all of these years
I finally had my own damn computer chip the guy with big ears I

the guy's ears were extremely large
I was surprised they even stood up on their own 

I was surprised they didn't flap over 
like a dog's

they were about four stories tall 
and he was relatively short 

he was even shorter than me 
and I'm not very tall by anyone's standard 

he lives in a town not that far from here 
there are a lot of windmills around there

it was nerve wracking when he got anywhere near
the windmills 

I really respected him 
he was a kind person and quite relaxed 

and he had some really interesting 
perspectives 

I would like to hang out with him again one day 
and I hope we get the chance again 

sooner 
than later 
the guy with big ears II

the guy with big ears 
looked similar to how I did 
when I was a kid 

he wore a red t-shirt 
with a pocket 
and he worn out jeans 

he had black hair 
that was curly above his ears 
and he was bald, like me or my dad 

I was once walking down the street 
with him
and out of nowhere he did a crazy dance

I'd never seen anything like it
and everyone in the street 
thought it was great 

I usually don't care about 
watching people dance
but this was something else 

he shuffled his foot 
and twisted around 
almost in a squirm 

without question 
it was the best dance
I've ever seen 

after he did the dance 
everyone in the street 
gave him a round of applause 

but he didn't care
he ignored them all 
like it was nothing 

we went on our way
and eventually stopped at the corner shop
and bought some sodas the guy with big ears III 

it took me some time to realize 
something

I was walking down the sidewalk 
when I saw 

that the guy with the big ears 
was none other 

than 
me

I saw myself in the reflection of 
a puddle 

and 
I couldn’t even remember when it had rained 

even though I had been out walking 
for almost two hours 

I thought of the windmills 
and I thought of that strange dance 

and I couldn’t believe 
it 

I went home 
and I slept 

and in the morning when I woke up 
I was wondering how I ever forgot 

that I was the guy 
with the big earscuring tinnitus

I have been relaxing on the couch for one hour or so 
considering tinnitus 
and thinking of grabbing a bag of chips from the cupboard 

I am imagining a cloud has come into the living room 
and is floating above the table and the chairs 
and I would have to try to vacuum it up

but then there would be a cloud 
inside of the vacuum
which seems almost satanic at this point 

I would wonder if breathing in
an entire cloud
would cure tinnitus

I can see how it would work 
it would be worth a shot
but now I will have to lure a cloud in here 

without anybody noticing 
and without
getting any rain on my cat 

he hates getting wet
and would probably kill an umbrella 
it if came near him new sneakers

now that the snow has melted
and the sun has been warmer

I have been considering getting a new pair of sneakers 
I went online and saw some different styles 

usually I have black sneakers 
but I began thinking of getting blue ones 

I saw ones that were blue and had an orange stripe on them
and another pair that were similar but instead had a yellow stripe

I thought the ones with the yellow stripe 
looked a bit better 

both looked very comfortable
and as good quality of any sneaker out there

I am not sure if I will buy a new pair of sneakers in the end
the truth is I still like the ones I already have 

I will consider it further
over the next few days the can of road zoodles

a can of zoodles 
rolled down the road 
towards a sewer

there was a guy
who dove into the road
and caught it

he almost got run over
he almost got turned into brisket
he almost got turned into zoodles himself 

he was honoured to have that can of zoodles 
he cherished it
even though he didn't even have a can opener

the truth is 
he didn't want to eat it
he just wanted to keep it in his room 

it was his can of road zoodles that he saved from oblivion
it was his can of road zoodles that he almost gave his life for 

he had road rash on his face
and on his knees 

he was sore as hell for two days 
but it was worth itthe electric guitar player

there was a guy that transformed into a bucket of drywall composite 
and one day I was walking across the room 
and I tripped on it 

it was strange to notice 
how that guy looked now
as a bucket of drywall composite 

I knew him from before
we actually went to the same elementary school 
we once got into a schoolyard fight 

he kicked my ass once or twice
and I also kicked his ass once or twice
I never hated the guy 

somewhere along the line I had heard he became an electric guitar player
and that he played for many hours 
every day

and now he was just a bucket of drywall composite
on the ground
it was hard to believe this is where we ended up 

but I suppose in the end 
it was true 
that not much had changed after all 

the window

it was pleasant to sit by the window this afternoon
for ten minutes 

I was holding a book
and considering what it said 

I don't know how long I will remember that moment 
perhaps I will never think about it again after this 

it was relatively insignificant 
even to myself 

perhaps one day 
when I become sick or upset

I will hope to return to that moment again
even for ten minutes the rat's dog food

the iron 
was plugged into the wall 
with an extremely long extension chord 
it was never unplugged
and one day it lit on fire 

the entire place went up in flames
including the ice machine
there was a rat in the wall 
who ran out of there screaming 
he cooled off in a nearby puddle 

later the rat was walking around an alleyway
and he found a tambourine 
and a can of dog food 
he used the tambourine as a can opener 
and ate the dog food 

he was sleeping on the roof of a nearby building 
thinking over what happened that day
he decided that it was worth getting lit on fire
because he was happy to find that can 
of dog foodthe mink fur coat

consider the mink fur coat 
that was stolen from the coat check 
last week 

was there a mink fur coat thief?
or 
did the mink fur coat fall off of the hanger 

and get 
sucked into the vent
and trapped in the air duct?

a lot of people have been speaking about this 
lately 
especially those with pet minks 

my opinion is that it fell off the hanger and got stuck 
I will throw a match down into the vent later
to prove my point ramen flavour pack  
a bag of ramen
was in the woods 

a squirrel ran towards it
and took it back home

the squirrel boiled some water
and poured in the noodles and the flavour pack 

the squirrel sat on the hillside 
and looked out at the horizon 

the squirrel ate the ramen 
in a peaceful way 

the squirrel drank the broth 
and watched the sun set 

the squirrel slept soundly through the night
and in the morning it watched the clouds pass in the sky becoming a twig 

I have stumbled upon a recent memory of a wet twig on the sidewalk 
I kicked it and it got caught in the heel of my boot before rolling off into the gutter

I will suggest to anyone who is looking for advice at this time 
to consider becoming a twig 

it is a way to be resilient 
it is a way to see the world 

I will hope to become a twig at some point in my life
unless I have become one already 

in that case I will have to take the time to understand 
that my purpose has been fulfilled the car accident

I was driving along 
in the rain 

listening to the radio 
and considering the other cars 

I accidentally crashed into an oil truck
and it exploded 

I went flying into the air probably thirty feet 
and I landed on the road 

none of the cars could see me 
and I almost got smoked by one

my car was toast 
and all my bones were busted 

but I walked all the way off the highway 
and got the mall

I went into the drug store
and got bandaids and aspirin 

I have been feeling better 
but I'm still pretty sore 

tomorrow I think I will skip my morning exercises 
and take it easy

a frog's tooth and an inside out frog 

as you may have noticed
I am not always concerned with doing things perfectly 

as you may have noticed
I am concerned with doing things perfectly as well 

there is a certain dread
and a quiet but chronic panic 

it has something to do with doing all things imperfectly 
or doing all things perfectly 

there is something in me that seems to feel the need to grasp onto some overarching method 
that could become definitive of myself 

like a doorknob 
acting as a wheel on the car 

like a frog's tooth 
and an inside out frog a group of people

it is strange to say things in front of a group of people 
sometimes it’s a terrible feeling 
and other times it can go okay

I would say that I have slowly gotten better at it 
over the years 
but I still get nervous whenever I have to do it

one of the difficulties 
is knowing what the hell you’re 
even saying 

sometimes I think I know what I’m saying 
but when I speak in front of a group of people 
I realize that I don’t 

I would say that’s the benefit from talking in front of a group of people 
it is a way to tell 
if what you think you know, is actually true 

the moment the words leave your mouth 
it becomes clear 
in your gut 

I am interested in having the opportunity to sort that out 
but first 
I have to take the time 

to write out my thoughts 
without that 
there is nothing pepperoni glitter

I spent some time at the library 
this afternoon 

reading the first page few pages
of some books

many of them described how the light was shining
through the window

I was irritated by those descriptions
for the most part 

and so I did not take any of those books 
home with me
 
as I continued to 
look at the titles

two young guys arrived and 
sat at one of the tables 

they ate pizza
and watched videos on their cell phones 

the sun was out
it glittered off the pepperoni the spider's prerogative

it has been disturbing 
to think of the tape 
that floats towards the ceiling 

perhaps a spider had tried to take it 
home
and forgot about it 

the spider's prerogative
has become my concern 
in this moment 

I will not be surprised 
to wake up tomorrow 
with two inflamed dots on the back of my neck 

I will know it was not a vampire 
who did it
it was the office spider

who was decorating 
the ceiling 
by a hanging piece of tape 

and wanted to affirm
that its prerogative 
was its own  
intermittent foxes

I was standing around
considering things 

when my wife came 
into the room 

her nose was bleeding 
for seemingly no reason 

somehow it reminded me 
of the fox I have been seeing around the neighbourhood 

it is good our noses don't bleed 
perpetually 

though I am unsure 
if we're better off with intermittent foxes 

we saw a frog in the mud today 
I would guess that would be a good thing for a fox to eat

we saw a rabbit on the hillside 
and worms on the path 

tomorrow I will begin editing my new book
I think it will take me through the spring 
sabotage, the creek

the creek 
has become a meeting place 
for many people 

they go there 
and sip their drinks
and talk about their business

lately there has been a group of villains there
from what I can tell
they are working on a master plan 

they intend on taking over the entire planet
and then selling it 
to martians 

at first I wasn't alarmed by what I heard
I thought they were out of their minds 
but I have overhead many details I cannot ignore 

I am trying to decide now
if I will try to join them
or if I will try to sabotage them 

I will consider this 
carefully 
before coming to any major decisionsthe mangy neighbourhood fox

my wife tried to feed cheese
to the mangy neighbourhood fox 

his tail is just a thin pencil line
his fur is black and a lot of it is scratched off 

I saw him run across the road 
towards the garbage cans 

I hope he has a decent spot to sleep 
and that it doesn't rain again tonight

I hope he doesn't eat anyone's pet cat
or dog

perhaps he will find the frog in the park
or the duck we saw in the mud 

I saw him from the window
trotting along the sidewalk

I hope he will find his way 
wherever he is going   old times

I neglected to mention to anyone
that there was a snail on the step yesterday afternoon

I noticed it after I went to the garage to get 
eggs

I was unconcerned by the snail
since it was very small

I was reminded of a snail 
I once saw 

it was enormous 
it was the size of four wheelbarrows 

it was the size of two cows
and a horse 

no one knew what to do with it 
and in the end 

some guy just walked up with a shotgun and just shot it in the head
it was strange to butcher the snail

most of the snail meat ended up getting grilled
as steaks

it fed a lot of families 
through the whole summer

but some people froze what they had
and ended up making soup out of it in the winter 

it was nice to think back on those those 
old timesabhorrent crime

the dolphin
sold all of its organs
to the starfish community 

lately the starfish 
have been paying a lot of money 
for dolphin organs

they are interested in learning the dolphin language
without vocal chords they cannot speak
but they can translate it into sign language 

they create small motions in the water
and can travel considerable 
distances 

the intention 
of the starfish
is to create their own police force

they will weaponize 
this technology 
that they are learning from the dolphins

if you think things have been bad on land lately 
then you've got no idea what things have been like under water
something must be done about the rampant and abhorrent crime small cardboard box

the sun went into a small cardboard box
and some guy duct taped it closed

he put it under his bed and left it there
for almost a year 

everyone was sad that it was so dark all of the time 
no one understood what had happened, except the guy 

he felt guilty as all hell 
but was too ashamed to tell anyone what had happened 

and if he ever tried to sneak the box out 
he would for sure get busted

and then one day he woke up 
on fire

that damn sun had finally cooked through the box
and torched the bed

everyone for miles 
saw the guy run from his house 

they saw the flaming streak
and his shrill scream 

he jumped into the river
and cooled off 

he lay on the beach 
and in the distance saw the sun rise for the first time in a long time 

he was happy to see it 
but he had to continue down the river, he had to follow his shadow 

because everyone knew that he was the one that stole the sun 
there had never been a fugitive like him beforedead in a blink

there were many people in line at the store
they were buying all kinds of weird stuff 

buckets of pork rinds
and boxes of coconut water

there was some creature 
who came through the aisle 

he moved like a satanic fish 
and was perhaps the size of a small dog 

he was shadow along the concrete 
black lightning 

and when he opened his mouth 
he revealed he had teeth like bloody pylons  

I watched him eat a woman whole 
including her shopping cart 

and then he darted off 
and hid behind a flat of guacamole 

we were lucky to have gotten out of there alive 
but I suppose, in a way, there are worse ways to go 

maybe that woman got off easy 
dead in a blink 

two foxes

some pizza box 
was on the road
it was stained in grease 

there were two foxes 
who ran towards the pizza box
and there was a slice for each of them

they ate the pizza
and sat on the asphalt 
and then went back to the field 

one of the foxes, 
the black one,
looked up at the sky and it became dark 

he thought to himself 
that who he was, was not who he had become, 
it was who he had always been 

eventually it began to rain 
and they trotted off into the trees
they hid under the canopy and they slept 

in the morning they returned to the pizza box
they did not find any more slices
they went further down the road worm soup

there is a gust of wind 
going down the street
towards the two foxes 

they had noticed
that finally the air was warm
and they were happy about that 

one of the foxes 
squeezed his paw into the dirt
and felt there was a worm there

the fox had seen many worms before
and sometimes he enjoyed 
worm soup 

but today 
he did not feel like worm soup
or any kind of worms 

he just wanted to stand 
and notice the wind
and how warm it had become 

he was not surprised to see the other fox
eating the worm he had found
and also eating a piece of a croissant that he found on the ground 

the other fox did not care about the wind
and he was becoming quite bored 
of standing aroundI hope that he will be okay

it was sad to hear that 
this guy I used to know got small pox 

I hope that he will be okay
I hope that he will not die

I forget his name actually 
and I don't remember what he looks like or much about him

I think we were in the same high school class 
or something

I just got a message 
and apparently 

the man is dead now 
there was nothing anyone could do to save him

I would have gone to his funeral
but I already made other plans and I would feel bad cancelling 

perhaps I will visit his grave one day, 
I'm not sure how I will find it

since I can't even remember 
his namethe lizard 

a lizard 
went under a paper towel
that fell out of the trash can 
by the pizza parlour

it became night 
and he slept under the paper towel
he awoke at one point 
and saw a meteor shower

in the morning 
the sun was scorching 
and he looked at the sky 
but he could not see the meteors anymore

he travelled towards where he saw the meteors fall
for many days
and looked back
to the pizza parlour 

he thought of returning
but he wanted to see if any of the meteors landed in the desert 
so he continued 
and that is why the lizard scurries across the highway, towards the sandwalking into the sunset

the lizard crawled along a needlepoint 
and turned itself inside out 
its innards became its skin 
and its bones evaporated into dust 

it was strange to see a lizard like that
crawling through the gutter of the slushy machine 
through the blue raspberry flavour 
and the banana flavour 

the lizard released a howl 
that was deafening to the people in the convenience store
and it ate the head off of a man 
who was browsing energy drinks 

it was strange to see a lizard like that 
eating through the nostril 
and chewing the brain 
of that man 

I left and walked down the street
the sun was hot on my face
I rolled up the sleeves of my jacket
and I undid one of the buttons on my shit 

I listened to some music on my headphones
and felt the concrete under my sneakers
and it occurred to me that I myself may have been the lizard that was eating that guy's head 
the truth was unclear to me in the moment

and some guy was sitting on an electrical box
outside of the parking lot, he was playing a guitar 
and I walked into the sunset 
never to be seen again racoon teeth 

there were eleven dead racoons 
on the side of the highway 
they had all been hit by a car carrier trailer 

one of the racoon jawbones was wedged into the wheel
the truck driver noticed it there when he was getting fuel 
and some soft drinks

he yanked out the jawbone out of the tire and inspected the teeth 
they looked damn close to a dog's 
he hosed off the teeth and peeled off the flesh with his knife 

he liked having those raccoon teeth 
they made him proud 
and they made him sad 

as he drove he couldn't stop thinking about those dead raccoons 
so he turned his truck around 
and went back to where he hit them

it was nighttime 
and he walked around the road with a flashlight 
looking for the corpses but they were all gone 

he thought it would serve him right 
to get knocked into roadkill himself right then and there 
but there were no other trucks on the road 

eventually he got back into the truck
and he checked in to a hotel 
he watched tv for some time 

until he went to the ice machine 
and he got some ice for the soda he bought earlier 
he fixed himself an ice cold soda

and he sat on the porch there and looked out at the road 
and stared off and thought about all of those dead raccoons 
he didn't sleep at all

he knew that driving was more or less a death wish
but he felt like he deserved it
after what he'd done lemming's hell

egregious tooth clips 
have transformed

and people have wondered
how they will reupholster themselves

there is no requirement 
to win over a lemming's heart

there is only a can of tuna 
to serve to a lemming, in gratuity 

it is sad to think of the lemming's fate
but it is inevitable 

do not consider it
unless you are willing to read a dissertation 

do not consider it
unless you are going to write the entire dissertation without supervision 

you can call it 
the lemming's revenge 

you can call it 
lemming's hell  glueing the frog

nothing
could be used to glue the frog 
to the rock 

instead the frog 
jumped along the staircase 
and onto the shotgun 

the tire rim 
rolled down the driveway 
and the windshield was obliterated

the shotgun 
had fired against everything 
including the glue, but not including the frog 

the lesson was clear
and remains clear
never, ever

try to shoot a frog 
that you thought was a statue 
glued to a rock

it will launch
and get your vehicle destroyed
the warning is clear 

there is the frog there
he jumps along the road 
towards the daytime moon the new bylaw 

the fish 
has dismembered itself 

in protest 
to the new bylaw 

it was a righteous choice
by any account

but still 
it did not cause the bylaw to fail

now 
the fish can be seen

playing chess
with some of the other guys 

they enjoy the game
and they play many times each day 

the fish 
is not the best player around

he is good
and he wins sometimes 

but there are a lot of guys who are better than 
him

he does not care about winning that much
it is nice when it happens 

but when he loses
he doesn't get too worked up 

I will say this
the fish is a hero to many people

whether he realizes it 
or not

he is a man of dignity 
and integrity 

even though he loses chess constantly 
and dismembered himself for a cause he did not champion in the endthe termite explodes 

there is dynamite in the termite's mouth
he was nibbling it in the mine 

the termite is walking down a thin line of gasoline
that dripped from the gas station nozzle 

the termite walks through a field 
many firecrackers are exploding above him

the clouds are filling with strange lights
and the termite goes into an apartment building

he is in the elevator 
going upward

he is walking down the hallway along the rug
there is dust on the rug 

he walks around the hallway aimlessly for almost two hours
before entering the elevator again 

the termite leaves through the lobby
and walks down the street, admiring the fireworks

not for their garish exhibition 
but for their persistence 

he enters through the mail slot of someone's doorway 
and sees the fireplace below the television

there are commercials playing 
he walks into the fire and -- 

the explosion exceeds that of the cumulative power of the fireworks
the termite has blown himself to smithereens 

not only was it the dynamite in his system 
but the fuel that had soaked into him from the gas station 

the fireworks now play second fiddle 
to the house fire

but in the distance they color the smoke 
a black ominous cloud filled with strange light the silhouette of a toilet plunger

the semantics
of a peculiar notion 
have revealed themselves
in the silhouette of a toilet plunger
among the trees 

it has been said
that the task
has solely to do 
with the unclogging the drainpipe 
that most would be too ashamed to notice

a group of cherry blossom trees
are flaming 
on the cliffside
and they are falling 
towards their doom 

they have taken the shape of toilet plungers 
in silhouette
as they burn and fall 
towards the dirt 
and the alcove below 

it was sad and pitiful to see them burn 
but the truth 
is that they would not have lasted much longer
anyway 
regardless of the fire the legend of the centipede

the centipede walks along a quill 
instead 
of taking the usual way 

it saw one of its friends
walk through a band saw
through the eye of the blade

the centipede missed his friend's funeral 
because he forgot 
and he has not taken the time to go to his tombstone

he is too busy 
pondering 
staring at his reflection in the glass

if the band saw blade came towards him
it may destroy the glass 
or it may destroy him 

he would be fearful 
and then dead
or not 

his friend on the other hand 
simply walked into the blade
perhaps by idiocy or by choice 

the centipede 
thought on it 
and then went home and watched tv until he slept 

he awoke in the morning 
and eyeballed the sun
until it became the moon again 

he considered the ghost of his friend 
he imagined that he was trapped in clay 
and put into a kiln 

and burnt into a long fang 
that fell onto the ground
and shattered 

the caretaker swept him into the dustpan 
and threw him away 
into the trash

there would be no funeral for the centipede
if that happened 
everyone would have just thought he ran away 

perhaps his friend 
died well 
he thought 
the twig and the bee's nest

the twig 
I have seen on the ground
has no gravity 

look at that twig 
floating 
above the cement 

look at that twig
floating
towards the dirt 

I have followed it for almost two weeks
towards the city landfill 
and past the city landfill

through the forest
and finally 
it stabbed a bee's nest 

and took the bee's nest 
back out of the woods
and towards the city 

look at that bee's nest 
floating 
away from the forest 

look at the bee's nest
floating 
towards the city 

it arrived at city hall 
and waited for someone to hold open the door
but no one did

instead they fled and screamed
I was stung for the first time 
when I reached over and pressed the automatic door open button 

the bee's nest 
is there
in city hall

it waits there 
steadily 
buzzing

I have found myself 
in the city hall cafe
enjoying an banana loaf and a coffee

I was very hungry 
from the journey 
and I am surprised I did not die in order to destroy the monster of the twig hive 

the monster 
of the twig hive 
has emerged in city hall 

it has no purpose 
it has no thoughts
or reason 

it has ground 
each pillar
to evaporated salt

it has ground 
each pillar
to evaporated salt dust mites

the fire department 
will arrive
as the police are crippled in fear 

the fire trucks 
drive slowly down the street
without sirens

the fire department will not use water
instead
they will use fire

they will go into city hall
and burn the monster of the twig hive
until it has faced certain death 

and if not
then they themselves 
will be defeated 

and that is the sacrifice they will make
in order to destroy 
the monster of the twig hive 

without them
I do not know who will stand up to the monster of the twig hive
without them, there's no telling what will happen sent from the clouds

notoriously 
the bee hive was destroyed by the fire department 

they burned it to the ground
and no one even got stung

people ended up feeling sad about that
they wanted to know about the floating bee hive 

they wanted to know about the phenomenon 
but it was destroyed in a heroic act

we will never know
why the stick floated that bee hive from the woods

and what made it go 
to city hall

people have their theories 
but none seem to hold any water

none are a cup
or a swimming pool

a river
or an ocean

they are merely single rain drops
kamikaze pilots

trying to abolish cement pathways 
sent from the cloudsthe quest of the milquetoast

the quest of the milquetoast has been profane 
for obvious reasons

there was nothing more to be said 
because of that

even those who could never stop talking 
had nothing to say at that point

the quest of the milquetoast showed a strange abomination 
of the worm soul of the motorized squid 

the motorized squid was born earlier today 
birthed from an evaporated ink splotch 

and meanwhile it was not profane 
not like the quest of the milquetoast 

not like the quest
of the milquetoast 

not like the quest 
of the milquetoast the fish who swam

the fish wasn't killed well
and it did not die well 

the story was badly written 
and the idea was not interesting 

the writer wrote poorly 
he was a fool with dumb ideas 

the fish was grilled terribly 
but I remembered it 

the story was badly written 
but I remembered it 

the writer was poor
but I remembered what he said 

the fish wasn't killed well
and it did not die well 

but it swam 
towards where it was swimming the cavernous scab 

the cavernous scab
has made a point

the turtle 
swims 

the turtle is ubiquitous 
the turtle is known to many 

but the cavernous scab 
is an outsider 

some call it 
a chimney cat

some call it 
a lasagna squeeze

some call it nothing 
at all

if you mention the cavernous scab
I would consider a box of paper

burning in the fire
the smoke rising in the distance 

if you mention the cavernous scab
know that it will dwindle in the horizon

and there will be no rescue 
for those who inevitably will heal carefully vacuuming the milk 

a sawtooth wave
goes along the water

oil smokes on a frying pan 
and separates the water

there are more chariots 
and horses

the sickness led to 
an unexpected death 

sand has arrived 
and will remain 

in perpetual 
exhaustion 

it is possible 
that a weight must be carried 

something that was left back in the sand
a long time ago 

we must turn back and find it 
and carry it back to where we are now

and if we don't make it back this far 
we will be better off

having dragged it along 
to wherever we get 

carefully
vacuuming the milk it is time to consider nothing

the peanut shell 
is a ghost pillow 
in perpetuity 

slinking the drywall
has become 
an infamous pastime 

a mirror spins down the hallway 
and melts 
into the sewer

a quiz 
has become the unanimous empire 
of donkey whiskers 

and if there is no reflection 
to notice in the water
I would say to find another fountain

otherwise 
there is little to consider 
and it is time to consider nothing that is me for now (worm oil)

eating worms again
grilling them 

worm soup
worm pie 

sacrificing worm excrement 
on the outskirts of town 

frankincense 
wormcense 

the cat claws the worm
and flings it towards the sun 

I am sitting in a chair 
burning the midnight worm oil

holding a can opener 
and

thinking of ground 
worm 

that is me 
for now it was not water

the wheelbarrow 
is stuck in blue goo 

two birds have come to sit in it 
hoping for water

but they have found nothing but hot metal 
trapped in blue goo 

so they have flown away 
and they may not return again 

the wheelbarrow sits 
until the blue good melts 

and then the wheelbarrow falls over
onto its side 

and rolls down the hill
making two lines in the grass

it approaches a break neck speed
and flies off the hillside, almost clearing the canyon 

if only those birds could see
how the wheelbarrow falls 

and how it will be destroyed
when it hits the rocks below

perhaps there will be water in it 
one day when it rains

the fate of the wheelbarrow is unknown 
and the birds may never return 

it is unknown what that blue goo was 
that the wheelbarrow was stuck in 

it was not water
it was something more strange than that 

perhaps it was something more strange than water
perhaps it was a melted birdthat damn lamb

courageously
I have worn slippers 
and walked across the grass
until there no grass
and only dirt 

I had no socks to speak of
and there was a lamb 
who looked at me 
blinking 
occasionally 

was I to kill the lamb 
and burn it 
or simply look back at
blinking 
occasionally 

I have since returned home 
and my crops have become diseased 
and I have a strange rash 
growing 
on my face

I will go to see that lamb again
I will walk passed the grass
into the dirt
and I will find the lamb
and kill it and burn it

I have since returned home 
and I did not see the lamb 
I suppose I will go to the doctor 
and get some cream for the rash
and I will pick up some pesticides while I am in town 

and that will have to be that
because I don't have time 
to go searching for that 
damn 
lambthe racoon's eulogy

another instance of road kill
has happened 

there is the raccoon 
he is deader than dead 

his jaw some fifteen feet up the road
his body inflated like all of the tires

he is a dead raccoon 
and his thoughts have ceased to occur 

but he always knew he worshipped a ruthless god 
so hypothetically he can't say this came as a surprise 

some days were better than others 
the raccoon would have thought, definitively 

eulogizing his time
he lay there on the road they are merely spools of velcro who cannot remember to microwave their pizza

a spool of velcro
has become a calculator 
for those who cannot remember to microwave their pizza 

a wire bends
as those who cannot remember to microwave their pizza
stare off into nothingness 

an electrocution storm occurs
sending tiny bolts of lighting through the velcro spool 
towards those who cannot remember to microwave their pizza

why then 
is there a calculator built into the microwave 
one of them asks 

but they do not know how to operate a microwave 
or a calculator 
and they are merely spools of velcro 

they are merely spools of velcro 
who cannot remember 
to microwave their pizza

I am unsure their fate
whether they will be swallowed into the earth 
and engulfed in flames, tomorrow 

or if we are to tolerate their idiocy 
until whenever it is 
that they are swallowed into the earth and engulfed in flames 

regardless 
it seems they will be microwaved into the earth and engulfed in flames 
like pizza for he was only a gummy worm

an envelope 
arrived 

there was a live gummy worm inside of it 
it squirmed along the table 

it was blue and yellow 
it was trying to get into some dirt 

it may not seem likely 
that there was a gummy worm of the sort 

but I'm not sure what to tell you
I wouldn't make up a lie for no good reason 

what use would all of this be
if it was all senseless nonsense 

who would dare
defile the pursuit of truth 

all of that integrity 
wasted 

all of that integrity 
was only gasoline 

senselessly 
dousing the flame 

like a gummy worm 
climbing through the mailbox 

towards the stairs 
and digging its head into the dirt 

I cannot blame the bastard 
for he was only a gummy worm the skipjack

there is no wisdom 
regardless of the kamikaze moment 

the knife cuts in two simultaneous directions
and the skipjack are indistinguishable from another 

the fish who swims towards the hook
the fish who swims towards the net 

it is difficult to know 
that the skipjack has died 

and a reminder 
of the river

splitting off 
one towards the ocean 

and the other 
towards the lake 

the skipjack lived in the water 
and it swam often

noticing the rocks 
and the dirt 

the more I think about it 
the more I realize 

that the skipjack 
was no kamikaze

the skipjack
was only swimming around one brave bird

a stick 
has broken off the tree 

a bird hops on the ground
looking at the damage 

the bird looks upward
and sees the cloud floating 

the one the lightning came from 
the one that has been lingering for many days 

everyone has told the bird 
that he cannot fly as high as that cloud 

but he knows that he must reckon with that cloud 
someone must 

because it keep sparking lighting 
at all the trees 

so he will see what the hell that cloud is doing 
and the day of reckoning will come 

that is one brave bird 
if I may say 

that bird 
is brave what's on

I saw a strange thing outside the car window
a women wearing yellow dish gloves
standing on the roof of her house and cleaning a satellite dish 

I don't know what purpose that would serve 
I would look it up in the dictionary if I could 
perhaps I could ask someone at the electronics store about it 

growing up my buddy had a satellite dish 
I couldn't believe how many channels were on that thing 
movies that just got out of theatres 

meanwhile 
I was standing in the yard 
sacrificing cattle 

trying to get a signal 
and wondering 
what's onit still feels damn sad that we lost our friend

do not step on the strange fishline 
that is on the dock 

my friend mike did
and it hooked into his foot 

and he was pulled into the water 
and never seen again 

perhaps we will find him one day
or perhaps he is sushi 

it is sad to think about mike 
even though he isn't real and that never happened 

it still feels damn sad 
that we lost our friend to barbecue my own brain

sometimes 
when I sit down to do my work
I become very tired

it is a strange thing 
but it is how it goes 
sometimes 

to barbecue 
corn 
to barbecue fire itself 

to barbecue 
my own brain 
to barbecue a propane tank 

and to think
merely days ago 
I was just sitting in my chair trying out my new pen 

I suppose tomorrow
I will wake up 
and drink my coffee 

and try again 
to work 
on something difficult consider glue clouds

glue
is dripping from a cloud
like rain 

and when the cloud goes near the sun
it will burn 
like the other clouds that have burned 

I have often found it strange to watch the other clouds burn 
like balls of pollen 
and lint 

but the glue cloud will be different 
it may glob down 
and be flaming goop 

it may become a strange kind of slime
that trickles into the sewer 
and mutates the rats 

as I reflect on this I realize
that mutant rats 
have never been the enemy 

it is those who grate against glue clouds that are the enemy 
it is those who are not glue clouds
it is those who do not consider glue cloudsthe helpful dictionary

it is strange to see the limit 
of my ability 

with no desire to rest
but a necessity to 

perhaps one more coffee
and another stab at the thing 

or perhaps it will be best to let it go 
and try to forget it for now 

sometimes I write quickly 
as you know

but other times
a story takes months, a year or two

I am unsure 
which is better in the end 

both, simultaneously 
probably 

lately I have felt my patience to edit 
has worn thin

the miserable worm hell 
of logic and ego

but still 
I have been giving most everything to it 

trying to focus 
and get it right

I will say this 
I will say that 

I am glad to have found this dictionary
in the neighbour's box 

it has been helpful
to have at my deskpatience the market

tomorrow 
I will sit at my desk 

and I will work on my story 
about the boy who killed the lunchroom guard 

in a way 
it is my best story 

I owe a lot to it
to make it as good as I can 

to boil off enough fat 
and to leave enough meat on the bone 

to not to cheap out on the details 
and to finish it

to not consider 
the market 

I suppose it is about nothing more 
than the patience 

to write
one word at a time the xanthan gum hellfire cockroaches

a container filled with xanthan gum and cockroaches 
a damn clear bucket
with an air tight lid 

some guy tossed it out his truck window
and it busted on the road
and sent some car spinning out of control 

the cockroaches 
ignited in the sun 
and blew up the road 

xanthan gum
hellfire cockroaches
scattered 

and ran across the highway 
and into the shopping mall 
and through the department store

all of the clothes got lit on fire 
and people were screaming 
and the cockroaches laughed

and they ran through the food court
and destroyed all of the expensive stores
and even burned down one of the movie screens

cinema 2 
is what they called it
the great cinema 2 

set ablaze
irreparably 
abolished 

by the end of the day 
the whole mall was destroyed 
burned to a crisp as they say 

the firefighters 
watched 
dumbfounded and amazed

what a sight it was
undoubtably those xanthan gun hellfire cockroaches
were something else the termite foundation of excellence

the termite foundation of excellence
has two awards

to award 
this year 

the nominees have been named
and I was surprised to see that I was on the list 

I have not won an award in a long time 
if ever 

I can see their thinking 
I can see why they want to give me the award

likely I will win 
well

there is a chance 
but I don't know if I will win 

in fact
I can see now 

why I won't win 
yes

it's true
they just needed more people to nominate 

and they felt guilty 
since I had written so much and they had not nominated me before

I don't think I will win
in fact

I'm sure of it
and I'm not just trying to protect myself from getting my hopes up 

I don't need that damn award! 
I'll keep doing what I do 

so I hope they don't give me any award 
because it will be distracting 

and I don't have time 
to go to the ceremony 

so 
I will say thank you for the nomination 

consider this 
my acceptance speech 

and know that it will better to give the award 
to some other guy 

thank you
and goodnight fish, eggplant, mango, rosemary, things like that 

I was walking along the road 
the sun was warm 
and there was some wind 

we had ate off the barbecue 
fish,
eggplant, mango, rosemary, things like that 

I would say 
that is the pinnacle 
of it all 

seeing the sun 
walking around
thinking about building a story 

salting the fish 
with a bit of olive oil 
and watching the fire roast it to hell

and then going on a walk 
the sun and the wind 
and walking along the road and looking towards writing again tomorrow another thought on salamanders

it is true 
that my compulsion to write about muffins has subsided 

but still 
when I sit 

I often think 
of salamanders 

doing nothing 
except perhaps walking along a residential sidewalk 

it is meaningless
but it is true 

and for now I will not say anything more 
about it that little bug is the man

that small green bug 
that falls from a tree

and goes on your shirt
and gets flicked off into oblivion 

that little bug 
is the man 

if anyone realizes 
or not

he knows who he is 
and he is willing to tell anyone about it 

he sits on the curb
and does whatever he wants

he eats garbage 
and walks through fire for the hell of it

you wouldn't expect it 
if you didn't pay attention 

if you were a fool 
you wouldn't realize 

that the small green bug
that falls from a tree

and goes on your shirt
and gets flicked off into oblivions 

that little bug 
is the man the fire ants

a chimney
with fire at the bottom of it 

and ants crawling 
in the fire

the ants 
wear fire retardants  

they are the fire ants
and they think deeply  

about recreation 
and spirituality 

it is amazing to hear their stories 
it is amazing to hear what they see inside of the fire 

they are among the greatest ants in the business 
they are among the greatest ants I have ever known 

they are ants 
that I am honoured to call my friends Elmore & Elmore's dog

elements of dog hair 
precipitate 
onto the jackfruit's spikey head 

as you may have guessed
that dog 
ran through the yard again 

I think that dog is named Elmore 
and he belongs to the people that live at the end of the block
the people that make all that tofu 

wait a second
the guy who makes the tofu is named Elmore
I don't remember what his dog's name is 

maybe I will go over to his place later
ask him if his dog is alright
and see if he wants any jackfruit 

I don't know
maybe I'll just stay in
and keep to myself 

Elmore's a nice enough guy 
and all
but I'm tired 

maybe I'll go over tomorrow
or see if I bump into him 
in the next couple days

ah damn
I'll head over there
it's probably the right thing to do wherever the hell they were coming from 

there was nothing unique about the plane that I saw 
it was just a regular old plane 
I assume there were people on it 
going from one place to another 
I was looking at it 
and it was just a regular old plane 

I saw a bug on the window
a spider
its legs sticking to the glass
it was there for a long time 
roasting in the sun 
doing nothing 

I was looking on a website 
someone posted that they saw a spider on a window
from their plane
they said it was a little yellow house
just like 
ours

it was a strange coincidence 
but I checked 
and that was the plane 
that I was watching
that guy who posted
was on that plane 

I didn't realize all that time 
I was looking at the plane 
with that spider
I just thought he was there
doing nothing
but maybe he was looking at the plane too 

I felt lucky that person didn't say they saw me
sitting there
staring at the plane 
but I think it was where my chair was positioned 
it must have been out of 
sight

a lot of people on the website
said that there's no way you could see a spider from a plane window
but I think I'll write a response 
and say that I was there
and I saw that spider 
too 

it was good they saw the spider
on the window
from the plane
as they were landing
from wherever the hell
they were coming from the salamander returned 

the salamander 
returned 

and stood 
looking at the vcr 

what the hell is thing 
the salamander said 

he crawled inside the machine 
and there was no videotape inside 

some guy pressed play on the machine 
he didn't know that the salamander was inside

the image on the tv screen 
became very strange 

and eventually a lightning bolt 
shot from the back of the tv and went into the sky 

and then the salamander stood on a cloud
going along 

piloting that cloud
like a sailboat 

it was impressive
it was awesome

and that is how the salamander 
became the cloud ship pilot 

that is why some people saw that
from the airplane windowthat narrow bastard snake

the snake 
who lived under the garage 

was narrowly a bastard 
and ate a box of cereal that a rat chewed the bottom out of 

he ate the rat too 
nabbed it when the rat was nibbling on that cereal 

I wasn't surprised to hear it
I once saw that snake eating a rock 

for no reason
I once saw that damn snake eat a rock for no reason 

if you've ever seen a snake eat a rock
just for the hell of it 

you'll know what I'm talking about
it's something else 

the snake who lived under the garage
was narrowly a bastard 

I think I will chop its head off
this weekend 

with the garden sheers 
I'm sick of that thing 

especially because of that time it climbed into the exhaust pipe of our car
and got tangled in the engine like a set of deranged jumper cables 

what a deranged set of jumper cables
that narrow bastard snake is 

what a deranged set of jumper cables
what a deranged set of jumper cablesthat dumb albatross

an ice cube 
is a friend to anyone 

especially to those enjoying 
a cold drink

but alas 
some kid got a bag of dolphin meat 

he dumped it onto the table
and he showed that it was unable to rot 

it had been butchered in such a way
that it was unable to rot 

it was a curious thing
seeing that rank plastic bag with a hole in it 

leaking off the table 
and onto the ground 

even him 
that dumb albatross 

had a cold drink 
as a companion 

even him, that dumb albatross 
who brutally slaughtered that dolphin into mincemeat

had an ice cube 
as a friend 

even him
that dumb albatross 

that vengeful bastard
with no remorse turn the dirt into mud

the mud
is wet dirt 

and that 
is all there is to know 

I know you are wondering about the leaf
and the worm 

but you have to trust me 
there is nothing else to know about it 

I'm sorry if you were expecting more 
I'm sorry if you thought there was some joy there

or some sadness 
or some interest 

but truly it is that banal 
I cannot apologize for that 

I cannot apologize for the mud 
I cannot apologize for the dirt 

but I suppose if I am honest 
I can apologize 

for dumping that bucket of water onto the dirt 
and turning it into mud 

genuinely 
I can apologize for that

I only did it out of spite 
I only did it to turn the dirt into mud scuba cats

an exhaustion 
and a conglomerate 
of pizza mites 

scuba cats 
have arrived 
in a small cardboard box 

they are ready to do what has to be done
in order to do what it takes 
to upend a notorious reputation in the business

but they are severe amateurs 
canisters of unbridled ambition 
empty jerry cans

they took cat nip in the doorway 
they have charged a low rate
and there was a promotion code

a feather underwater
some wingspan 
chasing after a lone egg

that's the extent of it 
that's where we're at right now 
regardless it's causing a lot of trouble 

I hope those scuba cats can deal with this mess
those pizza mites 
really have to get taken care of the gnats will hit the road

a person has got to soap out
and get the damn plate clean 

when you are washing the dishes
you cannot answer the phone

you must think your thoughts 
and you must be yourself 

whoever you are talking to 
will see what you are all about 

and they will see 
where you are at 

do not let the dishes pile up
do them

but if you do not 
and the gnats arrive

then do not freak out 
just do the dishes 

get the damn plate clean 
and the gnats will hit the roadAN INNOCUOUS QUEST

an innocuous quest had begun 
for a particular anteater

who was a coward
in relation to who he once was 

and he would overcome that 
in order to go on this innocuous quest 

but 
that was the last that was known from the anteater 

and no one ever heard from him
again 

it is unknown what the quest was
it is unknown if he had succeeded or failed on that quest

but what can be confirmed
what is confirmed 

from multiple sources
is that he overcame his cowardice 

and went on the innocuous quest 
and that is what mattered in the hearts and minds of many 

he remains an inspiration to this day 
to those who have remained cowardly in their quest 

including myself
including that melted tire on the road 

and I would put money down 
to say 

that you are included 
as well 

even that melted tire
is included in this

even that melted tire 
knows the cowardice

that the anteater overcame
when he embarked on the innocuous quest THE LIFE OF A STREETDOG

there was a line on the table
a hair or a mark of a pencil
no one knew 

it was there 
it had been an immeasurable amount of time 
something like forever 

and a gust of wind arrived
from the fan or the window
it was unclear where

and now that small line had moved 
and it was on the ground 
lost in the hardwood

the shadow of heat lines showed from the window
and passed over the line 
and caused the line to have a nightmare

where the line envisioned itself as a streetdog in the alleyway
digging out a garbage can 
and nibbling the flesh off of a fish skeleton 

and when the line awoke 
it realized that nightmare 
was in fact a great dream 

and perhaps one day 
they would arrive in the alleyway
to eat fish off the bone 

that is the dream that the line had 
to live the life

I will hope to one day visit a sewer 
to know what happens 
it is clairvoyant 

I know someone who went into the sewer once
and he said there were many clams on the shore
and foul coral growing 

he said it was disgusting 
but astonishing 
he said that he did not have the heart to return there 

the only other guy I know that went in the sewer 
was named Dave
he just stood in under the gutter and did not go far 

the grate blocked the light
and his sunburn 
was zebralike 

I have not seen Dave 
in many 
years 

Dave was clairvoyant 
enough
not to need to venture into the cistern 

but he was a good man
and was always able to keep his spirits up 
even when things seemed like they were going rough for him

FLY SOUP

sitting in the car 
a fly buzzing around 

I tried killing it eight times
maybe more

but still 
it escaped 

that damn fly
I would have killed it dead

I would have turned it into soup
for buzzing around my head 

while I was trying to read my book
in the car

waiting 
in the parking lot MAXWELL HOUSE AND THE CORNISH HEN

the Cornish hen... 
I do not remember its name

it is possible that the Cornish hen 
truly has no name 

and it is possible that Maxwell House
has a name but is merely a faceless house 

but still 
I know that the Cornish hen walks through the field 

outside of the Maxwell House 
and there is a hunter in the trees 

wearing an orange vest
aiming his rifle towards the Cornish hen 

it will be sad to watch the Cornish hen get shot
I wish there was something I could do 

but I am merely the person imagining that Cornish hen 
as it chirps around the Maxwell House 

and I cannot stop the hunter 
from pulling the trigger 

I can only wish the best 
for the Cornish hen 

as it walks towards the shadow
of the Maxwell House 

this is the reality 
of what is going on 

this is the reality 
of what I know

perhaps we will revisit the situation another time
perhaps we will revisit 

Maxwell House
and the Cornish henWHAT IS COMING NEXT

sitting on the subway 
and reading my book 

some coffee left in my thermos 
and trying to settle my nerves for the day 

it is strange to be among people 
it is strange to look around the street and see people doing whatever they are doing 

eating my sandwich
and standing on the sidewalk

and still drinking my coffee
and looking around the street again at all of the strange people 

I was here once before 
and another time before that 

and now here I am 
again 

a general sentiment 
towards nothing 

aside from time 
passed

and what has happened 
since 

I suppose if I got here
I can keep going 

I will see what is coming 
next THE AIR CONDITIONER

there was always a lot of dust behind that air conditioner 
it was a strange place to take a nap 
but it was peaceful there 

I spent a lot of time lurking around that air conditioner 
so when it broke down 
I became a bit sad 

it was too heavy for me to lift on my own
so I called some guys to pick it up 
and trash it 

they load it up into their truck 
and drove off
and I didn't think I'd ever see that thing again 

but then one day 
I was walking down the side of the road
and there it was 

floating above the grass 
like some spaceship was trying to lift it off the ground 
but it was too heavy 

it was damn strange to see that 
but I have to say 
I was quite happy about it 

I went back a few days later 
and it was gone 
but at least I got to see that air conditioner one last time THE DAMN VAULT

I have hoarded money in a vault 
for some time

but yesterday when I awoke 
I had gone to deposit some cash 

and I could not remember where the vault was
–– I think I have lost the vault 

it is sad in a way 
but in another way, I feel nothing 

I suppose I could have bought some more stuff
a new pair of pants

but I'm realizing that maybe it wasn't about the money 
it was about something else 

it was about taking the money 
and depositing it into the vault 

I enjoyed the walk
and the habit of it all 

I don't intent to be optimistic 
but I'm realizing I have a lot of enjoyment ahead of me  

walking 
and

trying to find 
this damn vault SQUID FOAM IS QUALITY EXCELLENCE

It happens 
that sometimes 
my cat and I yawn 
simultaneously 

sometimes I wonder
what portal may open 
in such a synchronistic 
moment 

where we might get transported to 
some strange dimension 
or perhaps
nowhere at all 

either way, it doesn’t matter 
we’re exhausted
from kicking ass all week 
and now it’s time to relax 

we’re going to eat some snacks
and watch the season finale 
of one of our favourite shows
Squid Foam is Quality Excellence

THE FLOATING ANTHILL

an anthill floated down the middle of the road 
narrowly being hit by a truck 

but the truck swerved out of the way 
and hit a fire hydrant 

water blasted into the sky 
destroying a cloud 

and the anthill continued to float down the middle of the road 
it stopped in the middle of the intersection 

and a lightning bolt shot down 
from the cloud and hit the anthill 

some of the ants were zapped
and looked like tiny lightning bolts 

little sparks falling onto the road 
and scattering off 

and then the anthill continued to float 
past the intersection 

and off to the construction in the road 
and then it floated downwards 

beneath the road
where the construction was 

all of those little spark ants 
I never saw where they went 

but I have always remembered that floating anthill 
as one of the best things I have ever seen I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE MISO SOUP AND EACH PLATE

I will dream of that sushi 
the wasabi 
and the rice 

I will always remember the miso soup
and each 
plate 

I would hope each person 
takes the time 
to eat sushi like that 

I would hope each person 
has the opportunity 
at least once 

it is very possible
that I may not eat sushi like that 
again 

and that is okay
because as I said 
I will always remember the miso soup and each plate THE WITCH'S FIRE

I had not noticed there was a fire alarm above my head
but it is good to know that it is there

in case it starts screeching in the night 
I will know where to swing a broomstick 

to shut it down 
but where is the damn broomstick 

I will steal it from a witch 
the one that flies over the house every night

perhaps lighting that witch on fire
and stealing her broomstick... 

perhaps that 
is what triggered the smoke alarm 

the witch's fire 
and the screeching smoke alarm 

and the guy swinging her broomstick 
trying to shut it down 

and if that smoke alarm remains quiet 
I will sit here 

drinking my bubble tea
and eating my salmon roe WAKE FOAM

a strange disillusionment 
perhaps inside of a pasta noodle 

a strange disillusionment 
perhaps off some dolphin skin

I'm unsure at the moment 
as I am often unsure, at any moment 

a mosquito has bitten into a cloud
and drained its blood 

a mosquito has flown back down to the grass
and put all of that cloud blood 

into a pasta noodle
that I have ate 

and that I accidentally vomited
into the ocean 

it arrived eventually 
on some dolphin skin 

only for a moment
before washing off

and becoming some strangely disillusioned 
wake foam THE PLAQUE

a strawberry-less pesticide 
was flung off a tape measurer 

and went across the road
and landed on someone's little library 

and it went up in flames 
just like that 

I tried using the nearby fire hydrant
but no one had a wrench big enough to get the water

so the little library burned down 
and now it is gone 

we will erect a plaque 
to commemorate the death of that little library 

we will always remember it
and we will think of all those books that got burned that day 

never be facetious 
with a tape measurer and a strawberry-less pesticide 

and please make sure to visit the plaque 
every once in a while
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU EVEN DOING MAN

I saw a guy 
walking down the street 

he put his green water bottle down and hid it in the weeds 
and then he kept walking 

what the hell are you even doing 
man 

I tried to ignore it 
and let that water bottle melt in the sun 

but the memory has remained 
like a leech on a snail shell 

like a vice grip 
holding two cupcake together 

that guy was wearing sunglasses 
backwards on his head 

that is a strange compulsion 
in my opinion 

I will go on record 
saying that guy is not to be trusted 

I will go on record 
saying his advice should be questioned permanently 

even when he is talking about neptune's dreamscape 
even when he is talking about a cobbler faced zone 

even when he is talking about the discman prophesy  
even when he is talking about some callous star IDIOCY, BULLSHIT & INSECURITY

I have thought of three things 
to describe my realm 

idiocy, bullshit 
and insecurity 

it occurred to me while sitting 
outside, on a chair 

it is true that my intelligence is 
what it is 

it is true that I don't have much to say 
about people 

it is true that I am not much of a mystery or thriller 
writer

but I have a penchant 
for 

idiocy, bullshit
and insecurity 

somehow it makes me feel
like myself 

and I can celebrate 
that 

as I do 
each day 

except last night 
I was walking with my wife and eating a bagel 

we were downtown
in the area where people go to look rich and have fun 

and I would say it made me sad 
to see all of that excess fun 

even walking with my wife
each of us carrying a full bag of groceries 

and eating a bagel 
I still felt sad 

seeing all of that 
vomit culture there 

in the neighbourhood
I used to live in 

I am feeling better
here in my office 

with my idiocy, my bullshit
and my insecurity THE GLASS OF JUICE

the glass of juice 
has been made 
from fridge water 

I suppose I am slightly fearful 
of mephistopheles 
even if he too is merely fridge water 

to be fearful of mephistopheles 
is to believe that he exists 
what an admission that would be 

if I remember correctly 
he transformed himself into cocker spaniel at one point 
so do not think that he could not become fridge water

but here I go 
drinking my glass of juice 
drinking my glass of berry punch 

perhaps I've made a deal 
with mephistopheles himself 
but in the meantime, as I wait

I will sit 
and play 
computer games THE TOOTH OF A SNAIL

the tooth of a snail 
floats 
avoiding gravity 

to what great honour to do we owe
to the tooth of a snail 
as the rules of gravity do not apply to it 

there it is 
the tooth of a snail 
moving through the dust 

destroying a black hole 
before it had the chance to form
before it became a vacuum outlet 

in the hallway
sucking up all of the dust
in the house 

the vacuum outlet 
was opened 
and the entire house was sucked into it 

and all that was left
–– as I know you have guessed
was the tooth of a snail 
THE FLYING EYEBALL

he was hit on the back of the head by a soccer ball 
and his eyeball flew out of his skull 

across the field 
soaring 

higher towards the sky
passing through it all 

into outer space
the eyeball flew into outer space 

seeing hordes of trash 
and busted satellites 

and landing, eventually 
on the moon 

the man still standing there in the grass 
reaching outward

not to search for his eye
but to feel the lunar air 

the kids had stopped playing soccer 
and stared at the man 

their coach was going to have to go and see 
if he was okay 

COMPRESSED AIR AND CLOUD SHADOWS

I have been thinking of my dead friends lately 
we weren’t on the best terms before they died 

it’s easy to think of how I could have been better
but it is what it is 

more so I suppose 
I miss them 

each in their own way 
it’s taken some time to admit that 

or perhaps
to even realize it at all 

in a way I feel closer to them now 
that they are memories 

now that they are compressed air 
and cloud shadows 

I have the sense that it may be peaceful for them 
to be dead 

I don’t think I’ll die anytime soon 
things seem to be going well
AN EARWIG MUFFIN QUEST

a box with an earwig muffin inside
this one guy took the earwig muffin 
and used it to lubricate his bike chain 
and it worked 

damn 
that is one fast bike 
damn 
look at it go 

zooming through traffic
passing the delivery bikes
passing the scooters 
passing the motorcycles 

that is one hell of a way to get around
great exercise 
low cost 
and elegant 

so long as you can get your hands on an earwig muffin... 
but that was the last one in the box 
and frankly I don't know where you can buy one 
they're sold out at every store I checked

they're sold out online
and it's tough coming by a decent recipe 
so good luck to you
in your earwig muffin quest

and if you find any 
let me know 
because I'd like to try one out 
some time THE HORNET'S LIMOUSINE

a hornet 
sits in the back 
of a limousine 

speeding through every street 
without reason 
flames bursting from the engine  

the hornet laughs 
hysterically 
going through the drive thru and the car wash 

eating hamburgers 
nuggets
fries 

roasting the car wash 
the flaming suds 
and the spinning mop things 

there is no driver
the hornet controls the limousine 
with its mind 

no one knows when it will stop 
it has been going on four days 
already 

that is the story of the hornet 
who sits in the back of the limousine 
and laughs 

meanwhile 
I've been at home 
trying reading my book 

eating takeout noodles 
and watching a couple of movies 
my car's parked on the street 

I don't care about limousines 
or making a scene 
like that hornet 

that guy needs to learn to calm down 
that guy needs to learn 
how to read a book 

but I know
it's hard to relax
sometimes 

so you have to do 
what you 
have to do WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE GHOSTS WHEN THE EARTH EXPLODES

we were walking in the park 
drinking a soft drink 
a green apple sparkling water 

we have been walking in a new route lately 
along the path 
and then by the trees 

usually we go for two walks each day 
one after lunch 
and one after dinner 

it is always a great idea 
to go on a walk 
for no reason 

it is banal
and peaceful 
and I hope to go on a walk every single day for the rest of my life 

even when I'm dead in the dirt
I will still hope to find a way 
to go on a walk 

I hope to become a ghost 
so that I will always be able 
to go on a walk 

even if the earth explodes
I will walk on another planet 
or around outer space 

–– I will set some time aside to wonder 
what will happen to the ghosts 
when the earth explodesA MINNOW SWIMS AROUND THE MIXING BOWL

a minnow swims around the mixing bowl
dodging one of those hand mixers 

if he gets caught in the whisk 
a sure death 

that would be bad
I hope it doesn't happen 

who is the damn bastard 
with the hand mixer 

trying to beat that minnow into muffins 
no remorse 

no mercy 
no respect 

just another damn bastard
with a hand mixer 

just another minnow 
trying to escape death 

just another minnow 
trying to jump stream 

from the mixing bowl 
to the drainpipe 

to the sewer
to the puddle

precipitating to the cloud 
raining back down into the stream 

that is the life of the minnow 
that is the life for me 
A DAMN STAR

it was strange to see a star inside of our house
floating in the bathroom 
above the toilet

this damn star was so bright 
even though it was tiny 
I thought it would have been bigger up close

but it is true that a star is always the same size
no matter how far away 
or how close that it is

I tried to get the star in a garbage bag 
but it seemed to be in its own dimension 
and I couldn't get it

the same thing when I tried a cardboard box
the vacuum 
oven mitts 

I'm was on hold with pest control for almost an hour 
hopefully they can do something about it 
but somehow I doubt they'll care

last time I spoke to them 
about mange foxes
they told me there was nothing they could do 

if they didn't care about mange foxes
then why the hell would they care
about this vagrant star 

my cat keeps meowing at it
and I keep telling him 
it's just a damn star 

but he wants to capture it
like a laser point dot 
he can't let it goTHE MOUSE TRAP AND THE GLUE TRAP

the mouse trap 
had fallen onto 
the glue trap 

and some guy 
wanted to grab it 
and get it off 

he thought he could pull the mouse trap
off of the glue trap 
if he was careful 

if he focused
if he was diligent 
if he believed in himself 

and so he lift the glue trap off the ground
and he grabbed the mouse trap 
and tried to peel it 

but it snapped shut 
onto his hand 
and shattered his knuckles

what a damn idiot 
what a complete fool 
what a severe imbecile 

he was screaming his head off 
and begging to be euthanized 
and the mice and the cockroaches 

crawled from their hiding spots 
and they were laughing their asses off
at this guy 

and to this day 
those cockroaches just crack up
out of nowhere

thinking about that dumb bastard 
and the mice too 
are laughing to themselves 

thinking of how that was 
the stupidest guy 
they ever sawTHE CLOCK RADIO

a swordfish was left on the staircase
and an alarm clock was plugged into it 

I thought it was a bomb
I thought there was dynamite inside the fish

I poked it with a broom 
to see if it would blow 

but it didn't 
it really was just a swordfish and an alarm clock 

I tossed the swordfish onto the grill
and ate the leftovers for a week 

I'd been using the alarm clock to wake up early 
I didn't have one before

everything was going alright 
but then 

the alarm clock wouldn't stop beeping 
and the next thing I knew 

all that swordfish I ate 
exploded and I got blown to bits 

it was a damn bomb after all 
I knew it 

I got blown up by that swordfish 
and its been a pain in the ass dealing with that

I'm basically a walking colostomy bag 
but I guess that's just what happens 

that's life 
as they say 

I still think I'm going to buy another one of those alarm clocks
I was enjoying having a radio beside the bed NEWT TIME

a single toilet 
remains in the area 

it is newt time 
and the piano has been shipped off 

I suppose I could sit here for the rest of my life 
considering this and that 

and it wouldn't be so bad
so long as the sprinkler is here

moving back and forth 
and going on my head every fifty seconds 

taking a piece of watermelon 
and realizing 

that you can eat all of the black seeds
that you want 

almost thirty minutes have passed
since I have ate the black seeds 

almost thirty minutes have passed
with this sprinkler going onto my head 

the piano has been shipped off
and the single toilet remains in the area 

but it is newt time 
and I suppose I could sit here for the rest of my life 

considering this 
and that THE BAT WAS THE MOST VALUABLE THING THAT THEY HAD

the bank vault 
opened 

and something peculiar
fell to the ground 

a metal 
spring 

it seemed that the light hit it in a strange way 
as it rolled away from the vault 

it did not bounce
it was still 

a bat then swooped downward
and took the spring 

and flew out of the bank 
carrying the spring into the daylight 

the bat screamed
as the morning sun burned its eyes

it flew off 
into a gutter 

and some hours later 
when the bank was opened 

the security guard saw
that there was a break in 

and they were very 
anxious 

when they reviewed the security footage
they saw

that the spring 
had popped out of the vault's lock

for no reason
aside from the fact 

that it was just 
cheaply made

they saw the bat's shadow 
on the screen 

they saw it 
grab the spring and fly off

and it took them a moment to realize
that the bat

was in the vault 
and that the bat 

was the most valuable thing 
that they had 

it was gone
and they had no idea

how it broke out 
of thereNEW BACKPACK

I bought a new backpack 
today 

since the zipper on my old backpack 
busted 

the zippers on the new one 
seem really good, like they won't get caught 

they have kind of a rubber piece on them 
to help 

the handle on top of the bag
looks like a bike lock

and the straps are comfy 
on my shoulders

I got it for a good price
sixty dollars

some of the other bags were over 
a hundred

I will wear it when I ride the subway
and go to my teaching job 

I was looking at the other bags
that some guys were wearing 
 
some of them looked too fancy 
some of them looked like they had too many bells and whistles 

but mine
is good

when I got home I tested it out 
I put all my stuff in 

my computer, books,
pens

there is room for all 
my stuff

and I think 
there will be room for my lunch too THE PURSE AT LEMMING SQUARE

someone left their purse
on a bench 
at
lemming square 

it sat there for days
getting rained on 
getting stared at
doing nothing 

until some kid came
and took it 
and tossed it into the fountain
and then it floated in the water 

slowly circling around the fountain 
antagonizing 
the coins 
with the strange shadow it cast 

the coins wanted that purse out of there 
so they prayed for it to leave
it was a wishing well 
after all

but the purse never left 
it just floated around 
doing nothing 
except casting that antagonizing shadow MY OLD BUDDY PAUL

drinking water
and thinking about my old buddy Paul 

he was hilarious 
I've never met anyone like him 

and I don't think 
I ever will 

he was probably the funniest guy 
I've ever met 

I laughed a lot more
when he was alive 

to 
Paul: 

rest in peace
& godspeed 

miss you man 
and I'm sorry 

1987 -- 
2019
LIVING MY LIFE

a carton of eggs 
cucumbers 
yogurt 

brushing my teeth 
using an exercise machine 
drinking a cup of water 

writing notes 
reading a book 
going for a walk 

scratching my cat’s head 
changing his water bowl 
giving him a spring to play with 

and
the rest 
is history NIGHT LIGHT

the sneakers
at carmichael square 
have gone on a massive sale

I’m thinking of stopping in later 
and seeing if they’ve got anything 
good 

but for now 
I have to continue scrubbing these pots and pans 
there’s a lot of burnt stuff crusted on them 

if I don’t go to carmichael square
I will stick around and read my book 
I’m almost on chapter ten 

this morning 
I saw a magpie eating a pigeon 
on the sidewalk 

and I am thinking 
it would be nice to have a night light in this room 
it gets very dark at night 
FOR OUR SODA MACHINE

seeing myself in an old picture book
and noticing a strange and quiet life
but a good one 

eating fries 
going on the computer
blinking 

climbing on things 
wearing a hat 
taking a wiz 

being curious 
and feeling strange 
sometimes becoming upset for long periods of time 

and other times dealing with a prolonged excitement
it took me at least thirty years to find some order 
after losing it at some point 

for no reason in particular 
that I can 
understand 

but that is enough about me
and what I saw in that old picture book 
instead 

I will mention something else 
there was a sale 
on copper frying pans 

five hundred dollars
instead of twelve hundred 
not bad 

but we did not buy them 
instead bought only a simple fan 
and some refills 

for 
our soda
machineIT IS POSSIBLE THAT EVERYTHING ELSE IS MORE OR LESS IRRELEVANT

at night there were gnat tornados 
floating above the sidewalk 
and a spider walking 

in the afternoon 
with the sun 
there were wasps and flies 

as well we have seen some dogs
a cat 
and a bunny

it is nice to have a house to go into 
when it is too hot outside 
and to sleep in at night 

it is nice to have a house to go into
to relax and cook some food
to read a movie and watch a book 

it is nice to have a house to go into
to be alone 
or to be with family 

that is as much wisdom as there is 
and it is possible that everything else 
is more or less irrelevant 
THE LATTER BREED OF APE

I was tearing wires 
out of my parent’s basement
and I came across an old thesaurus 
that I must have bought in college
it was so useless then 

the one I have been using recently 
is strange 
and I was thinking of getting rid of it 
but I liked the rabbit on the cover of it 
and I liked that it was yellow 

but this old one I found
is better
and for some reason 
it was just sitting there 
alone on the shelf 

if there is such a thing as fate 
(which there isn’t)
I would say that this coincidence 
was the magnum opus 
that was gifted to me from the heavens 

some people win lotteries
and some people find old thesaurus
in their parent’s basements 
and it seems that I 
am the latter breed of ape
SOME NONSENSE AND SOME CLARITY

a strange type of tea
spruce wood

a massive mosquito bite 
on the side of my head 

a fridge of mice 
commiserating 

a bedroom 
and a strange light 

we saw a small dog 
following a big dog 

it seems that things are okay 
for the most part 

I will hope that nothing bad ever happens again 
but when it does 

I will hope that things will return to the way they are now 
soon

SOME GOO-ISH INFERNO OR SOME IGLOO OF THE MIND

I finished reading my book and
it was awesome 

I don’t think I could write a book
that good

I don’t have a certain 
intellect 

and I don’t know enough about police 
or criminals 

instead I will write books that are perhaps 
a bit strange 

that explore some internal
disposition 

some goo-ish inferno or 
some igloo of the mind 

QUALITY & GREATNESS

the possibility of unintelligible nonsense 
stands here 

a little sign in the dirt 
that an ant can crawl onto 

a little sign that the wind should have taken out but now 
but didn’t 

what a prideful sign 
compensating for its idiocy 

perhaps the sign 
should read more 

perhaps the sign should try harder 
perhaps the sign should die by the hand of the wind 

but then where would the ant crawl 
and where would we go to see the unintelligible nonsense 

when our lives were too inundated 
with quality and greatness 

and glory 
and mastery 

and professionalism 
and all of that THE SLEEPLESS ANT

the ants crawling along the top of the gate
look at them go 

all day 
in the sun 

at night 
they go back home to rest 

like you
and like me 

but one guy in specific 
(whose name I will keep anonymous) was facing some turmoil 

he was wide awake
and he was looking up at the night stars 

he called me
and asked me what was up 

I said not much 
you

he said he didn't know 
and I could hear that something was up 

we didn't talk about anything 
but eventually he told me what was troubling him 

he said that he snuck off
and climbed into a watermelon earlier 

he said the sugar was racing through his blood 
and he was riding some ungodly high 

and he didn't know if he would make it 
he thought he would die if he fell asleep 

so I stayed on the phone with him 
until eventually he fell asleep 

I was pissed off
that I couldn't fall back asleep 

so I got up 
and went looking for that watermelon 

there it was
and look at that trail of ants 

scribbled from the inside of the watermelon 
leading 

towards the gate
heading off to who knows where PICKLE SANDWICH

a dill weed 
pickle

fell down
the staircase

the fan blew on it 
rotating 

dust went on it
and some odd hair 

now 
what sandwich will be made

I would like to have 
a dill weed pickle sandwich 

for 
lunch 

with no sauce
or cheese

just a sliced pickle 
on bread

perhaps I will rinse the dust off
of that dill weed pickle

that fell down 
the staircase 

...yes
I think I will 

despite what anyone 
says

and come to think of it 
I might even have some 

mustard on it 
as well ELBOW FLEECE

a container 
hidden under the stairs 

full of elbow fleece 
and feral cereal crumbs 

meanwhile 
I have been sick in bed 

watching tv
all day long 

without tv 
I don’t know what people would do 

they would probably be searching under the stairs 
for elbow fleece 

and feral 
cereal crumbs 

it is strange 
that someone ate a bat

and caused so much 
trouble BLANKETS HERE

I have many blankets here 
below the ceiling 

with my tea
and my water bottle 

I will have to keep sleeping it off 
until eventually I can return to writing my stories 

but until then 
I will be here 

watching other stories
on tv THE GAUZE

today I watched a tv show
for almost twelve hours 

I couldn’t stop until 
it was done 

it was a detective show 
and it was very realistic

a lot of bad things happened 
to the people 

I think one day 
I might watch the show again 

it was that good 
but it was not for the faint of heart

there were many brutal scenes 
including a close up of a surgery 

I had to look away 
while they packed the gauze 

one day maybe I will be tough enough 
to watch that

but it makes me nauseous 
as well as a scene where a guy’s arm got shot off

tomorrow, I will try to find another show 
as good as that 
ADMITTEDLY IT DOES NOT SEEM ENTIRELY PERTINENT

it has been very quiet 
and I have heard a tinnitus squeal 

I listened closely enough 
and I will explain what I’ve heard — 

vultures get a bad rep 
but they are not always doing what they do best

they are not always picking at the dead
they are not always yanking out eyeballs

sometimes they are just being vultures 
looking at the clouds 

sleeping 
or standing on power lines 

that is what I have come to know 
from listening to the tinnitus squeal

admittedly 
it does not seem entirely pertinent YOU HAVE EARNED YOUR RIGHT GOURD

picturing a gourd 
on a table 
in a room 
some guy's apartment that I went to ten years ago 

it is pointless
there can be no illusion 
as to how pointless
the image is 

I could explain what happened the gourd 
something miraculous 
something unbelievable 
something banal 

but there was no purpose to it 
in any capacity 
beyond any stretch 
of the imagination 

but it seems as though 
I find myself writing short sentences about it 
despite 
that 

ok gourd 
you win
you can have the table 
in that guy's apartment 

I suppose gourd 
you are less pointless now 
because now you represent 
futility and purposelessness 

you have earned your right 
gourd 
beyond 
a reasonable doubt STRANGE ORB OF SENTIMENT

I have been floating around 
over here and over there 

yanking out my nose hairs 
and using them as commas 

living in the air 
and being lazy 

eating a poke bowl 
staring at the edamame bean 

tomorrow 
right now 

nose hair 
comma

I was not put on the earth 
to be a smart person 

I have been quietly 
carrying and protecting 

a strange orb of sentiment 
since the early days 

it is here now 
surrounded by poke 
WORMS CRAWLED OUT OF HIS PUPILS AND HIS VEINS HAD BECOME ALFALFA SPROUTS

some guy 
was standing on the sidewalk 

picking a pebble out of the bottom of his shoe 
and then 

he got sanitizer sprayed into his eyes 
he was screaming in pain 

and worms 
crawled out of his pupils 

he ran 
to the grocery store, still screaming

the automatic doors slid open 
and he ran to to the frozen section

and he put his head into the ice cream fridge 
and the worms stuck to the ice cream buckets 

like they were tongues
licking poles in winter

he crawled into the fridge entirely
he lay there 

and he felt that his veins 
had become alfalfa sprouts 

he lay there 
for a long time 

eventually 
a woman came over 

and she opened the fridge 
and through the haze 

she saw 
the man, dead 

still she took the ice cream 
and put it into her cart 

she paid 
and drove home

when she was putting away her groceries 
she saw a strange bit of worm frozen onto the ice cream 

she reached for her sanitizer 
and sprayed the bit of worm

it wouldn't come off
so she picked it off with her thumb 

she washed her hands 
and the frozen worm bit went down the drain THE FASHION WEBSITE

I clicked on a fashion website 
and saw a photo of myself 

standing near 
a water fountain 

I had no idea 
I had become so famous for the clothes I had on 

I wasn't even wearing an outfit 
that I thought looked that good

it was just a normal shirt 
and a pair of sweatpants 

the editor of the magazine called me up
and said many people were clicking on my photo 

and he asked
what I was going to wear next 

I told him I didn't know 
and he said I better figure it out 

I went and looked at my closet 
and I had no idea what to pick 

I wished I had one of those shirts with a crocodile on it 
maybe I can find one second hand... 

I think they're pretty expensive 
if you buy them new 

but I don't have time to go shopping 
I barely have enough time to get my writing done as is 

I'm done with this 
madness 

if that fashion editor calls again 
I'm going to hang up on him 

I'll tell him I hope his magazine goes 
bankrupt 
THERE WAS A COW IN THE FIELD

there was a cow 
in the field 

all of the other cows 
had went off somewhere 

but he 
stayed 

he stared at the road 
not blinking 

every so often 
a truck would pass 

I had been at the convenience store
I bought a bag of chips 

I was eating them while walking down the road
and I was listening to the radio in my headphones

it was hot out 
I was wearing a t-shirt and sweatpants 

I saw the cow 
in the field 

I stopped walking 
and went over to him 

I put some of the chips in my hand 
and offered them to him 

he ate them 
and then he smiled 

thanks 
the cow said 

no problem 
I said 

I put my headphones 
on his ears 

and he nodded his head
along with the song 

he seemed to really like that radio 
so I let him keep it 

a radio can go a long way 
for someone whose on their own 

tomorrow I'm going to go to the store 
to get a new radio 

I'm going to go right when they open
so it's less busy 

I think I'll probably just buy the same one 
that I already had LEMON ATROPHY OF A SINGLE DOG LEMON

lemon atrophy
of a single dog lemon 

I was washing my hands earlier
in the bathroom 

I was thinking of lemon something 
but I can't remember what 

and now I am staring at an empty laundry basket
unable to remember the word 

I almost laughed when I thought of it 
it seemed funny 

I thought of changing my name to 
lemon something 

but I can't remember the word 
now 

after 
I washed my hands 

I sharpened the kitchen knife 
I scrubbed down the steel pans 

I cooked fish and rice
it turned out great 

but I am suffering now 
of lemon atrophy 

the book I am reading now 
had a small picture of a penguin on it 

you would recognize the penguin 
you have seen him before

it is strange 
it seemed that someone took a match 

and burned his stomach 
in a tiny circle 

I would say that the penguin too 
is suffering 

from lemon atrophy 
of a single dog lemon 
ALVIN IS DEAD

sorting through the frisbee box 
searching for one that flies best 

there is a message I must deliver
to a guy who can only be reached, by frisbee 

he lives in a strange tin box 
that is surrounded by a massive ditch 

there is a tiny mail slot 
in his door 

that is where you need to launch the frisbee 
and if you miss, the frisbee falls into the massive ditch 

he has no email 
or telephone 

the message I have to tell him 
is that his cousin is dead 

his cousin was the one who asked me to tell him
before he died 

I just write, Alvin is dead on the frisbee 
and toss it over the gap 

I haven't been able to get the frisbee in there
I've tried four times 

I'm getting sick of making the drive out there 
it's forty minutes out of town 

if this frisbee doesn't work 
I'm going to buy as many as I can from the dollar store 

and I'll just huck them, one after another 
writing Alvin is dead, again and again 

and if I don't get it
then that's it

I've got other things to do 
than toss frisbees at a tin box NIMBUS THE SQUID

what can be known 
of the squid

who is standing atop 
the tablets 

usually he is sitting at his keyboard
testing shortcuts 

he has pressed command
and every letter

he is trying to find a function 
that no one has ever found before

he is the desert squid 
who lives in a cave 

he lives on his own
he lives among the clouds 

he has been away from the ocean for so long
that he goes by the name Nimbus now 

his name is Nimbus
the squid 

he is disgruntled 
and is disproving of many lifestyles 

most people who have met him 
hate him 

and he wishes they didn't 
he cares deeply what others think 

but he does not know how to act
in a way that is redeemable 

he does not know how to act 
in a way that is forgivable 

still 
he sits at his keyboard 

and stands with his tablets 
trying to discover a function 

that no one has ever found 
before

I know the state wants to execute him
I know they want his head in the guillotine 

I know they want to decapitate him 
with a clever 

but I think that by the time they find him 
they will be unable to 

he will have found the keyboard function 
that will transform him 

into a nimbus 
cloud NIMBUS THE SQUID, II

Nimbus the squid 
was found on the side of the road 

he was found passed out 
next to a pylon 

it seemed that he was hit by some vehicle 
or another 

he is in the hospital now 
resting 

he hasn't said a word
since he's been there 

everyone has asked him what happened 
but he won't say 

this guy named Stuart 
said he was worried

that Nimbus was trying to get hit 
by the truck

and that Nimbus
was trying to end his life

I asked Stuart how he knew it was a truck 
and Stuart said that he didn't know, he just assumed it was 

I nodded 
and thought about what he said 

the truth was 
I had the same thought 

I know that Nimbus would never go to the road 
for anything 

at times I think that if Nimbus wanted to get himself killed
then there would have been no stopping him 

and at other times I think that if I would have tried to talk to him more
he wouldn't have done it 

it's also possible 
that Nimbus got hit by accident 

or even that someone was after him
someone might have tried to assassinate him 

we don't know
the truth of it 

I don't know if there will be justice
for Nimbus

I don't know if he even cares 
about justice 

one thing I learned from Nimbus
a long time ago 

is that sometimes it was an act of defiance 
to love what you do 

it was a sentiment I appreciated 
and I suppose 

that even if he did try to end his life 
it did not make it untrue NIMBUS THE SQUID, III

when Nimbus was released from the hospital 
he returned to his cave 

I went to visit him 
and at first he didn't want to talk to me 

he was walking down the mountain 
holding his tablets 

I kept following him 
and trying to get him to talk 

but
he wouldn't

finally, he asked me what the hell I wanted 
I told him that I just wanted to check in 

he said that since he was in the hospital 
everyone suddenly wanted to talk to him 

so I shut up 
and stopped bugging him 

I was heading back to my car 
and he told me to wait 

he admit that the reason he ended up on the road 
was because of a keyboard shortcut that he found 

it teleport him 
there 

he told me that he didn't want to share the shortcut because it was dangerous 
but maybe one day he would

Nimbus was a lot of things 
but he wasn't a liar 

it meant something that he trusted me 
with that 

I asked him what he was up to now 
and he said he was going down the mountain 

to smash 
the tablets

I asked him why 
and he said that after figuring out the shortcut 

he realized that everything he knew 
was a lie 

and he needed to start 
from scratch 

I nodded and stood there 
neither of us were sure what to say

he asked what I was up to 
and I told him that I didn't know exactly

I asked him if it was okay if I watched him smash the tablets
and he said 

that yes
it was 

so I followed him to the bottom of the mountain
and then he tossed them on the ground

and smashed them to bits
and now they are conclusively busted

I'm glad I went to see Nimbus
that day NIMBUS THE SQUID, IV

I have spent a lot of time reflecting on my time with Nimbus the squid
I'm not sure if I have come to any conclusions 

I'm not sure there was any wisdom 
to be gained 

I sat in my chair and noticed that the plastic thing was still pierced in my sock 
I pulled it out and tossed it in the trash

I hadn't realized 
that Nimbus took an oath of poverty 

he had put all his money into a shoe box 
and left it on his neighbour's porch 

in a way it was a noble thing to do 
and in a way it wasn't noble at all 

I went to the store 
and bought a pack of socks 

I brought them to Nimbus's place 
and left them outside, where he would find them 

I wasn't sure if I was doing him a favour 
or why I did it, really

I felt guilty afterward 
and I am unsure why 

but I will say that I've always respected Nimbus 
no matter what was going on

I always got the impression
that he was being true 
THEY THOUGHT HE WAS AN IDIOT, OR HIGH OR LYING

I have imagined a dolphin 
jumping through a band saw 

perhaps there are piles of saw dust all over the ground 
and no one has bothered to vacuum them 

one side of the dolphin is on the left side of the room
and one side of the dolphin is on the right side of the room 

it was a strange magic trick
performed by no one 

there were two manholes in the shop
I don't know why 

one of the guys that worked there once said that he saw a large fish 
jump out from one and land into the other 

but everyone told him he was an idiot
and they thought he was high or lying 

I don't know why they didn't have covers on the manholes
surely, that was a workplace hazard by anyone's account 

the truth that no one wants to hear 
is that sometimes dolphins end up in the sewer

it's a long journey 
and it's rare, but it happens 

I'm assuming that a dolphin 
jumped through one manhole

and aimed to land in the other 
but crossed the band saw on the way 

when the guys come back to the shop after the weekend 
they're going to have no idea what the hell happened 

but maybe that guy 
who they told was an idiot and who they thought was high or lying

won't seem like he was an idiot or that he was high or lying 
after all CHIPMUNK ON EARTH

perhaps there is no information 
to be considered 

perhaps it is all indulgent 
squabble 

perhaps it is garbage 
and snake oil 

no chipmunk on earth 
cares about doorknobs 

perhaps there is steel wool 
growing from the vine 

perhaps the fish's skull
was made of concrete in order to protect its brain against crashing into rocks

perhaps everything is okay 
after all 

I forgot to mention 
my electric toothbrush was low on batteries 

but I charged them up 
and it seems to be working better now I AM YOGURT TURTLING AWAY TOWARDS THE ROCKS

yogurt turtles from the horrendous idiots 
towards the rocks by the pond 

the yogurt floats 
turtle like 

towards the rocks
by the pond 

away from the horrendous idiots 
who are greedy and entitled 

they are not animals 
they are not yogurt 

they are horrendous idiots 
orbiting their own diarrhea 

it is truly shocking 
but it is a fact of life 

some idiots 
cannot be reckoned with 

myself for instance 
am completely an idiot in certain ways 

but still I am yogurt 
turtling away towards the rocks 

and by the way 
I have an idea 

for anyone who is an idiot
regardless of how horrendous 

there is an antidote 
go to the library 

get a book 
and sit quietly in a chair 

its an idiot proof solution 
to any problem 

regardless of rocks and ponds 
regardless of floating yogurt SNOT IN THE FIELD

the combine was miscellaneous 
as snot in the field 

a massive chunk of dirt was balancing on top of a power line 
like a vasectomy 

a salamander's vasectomy has become the antidote
for horoscope logic 

I was immunized by screen saver juice 
and now my fingers won't stop refracting off the graze 

and by the way 
what kind of a stegosaurus doesn't have a discman 

a fuzz cat 
eats the doorway 

a thread of miraculous elbow noodles peels the light from under the doorway 
and puts it in a tupperware 

I buried it in yard 
and that is why the dirt 

has been 
glowing 

near the raccoon's 
hotel YOU ARE A DUMBASS

if you are an idiot... 
it is difficult not to be 

I hope I am a good idiot 
a smart dumb person 

I am good at saving money 
but I'm not good at making it

I work pretty hard 
but my career is more or less shit 

still, I have found a decent amount of contentment 
more than I thought I would 

I hardly ever read the news 
but I do floss almost every day now 

I am inclined to think 
that if I was smarter I would have more money 

the idiocy of that idea
is not lost on me 

but still 
I haven't let go of it 

its with me 
often

as I consider it now 
I am reminded of something a wise man once told me 

he said, man, 
you are a dumbass SZECHUAN ERGONOMICS

I woke up in the middle of night 
because there was a seagull in my bed 

it was flapping its wings 
and tickling my feet

I punched it in the head and tossed it into the hallway 
my cat jumped on it, ripped its head off,

clawed out its insides 
and kicked it down the stairs 

we went back to bed 
and in the morning when we went downstairs the seagull was still there 

so I picked it up and tossed it onto the sidewalk
and slammed the door 

after lunch, when I went out for my walk, it was still there, dead on the sidewalk
so I kicked it into the road 

and when I came back from my walk there were tire marks indented into its guts 
so I hosed all of the corpse goop and the bloody feathers into the sewer 

now I am wearing a sweatsuit 
and practicing szechuan ergonomics 

I am sitting on the rocks 
and my ears have grown to be the size of phone books 

that is the entirety of my life at the moment 
except that tomorrow I will use one of the fast food coupons that we received in the mail last week THE MINK

I was on a walk 
and strangely, I saw this Mink I used to know sitting on the bench 

I hadn't seen him in a while and I was thinking of just walking by
but I decided to say hi

his hat was pulled over his eyes 
and he looked upset 

I asked him if he was alright 
he said he was good

I said, ok
and I thought about leaving him be, but then I said, are you sure man?

he said that he'd been having a rough go of it lately 
he lost his wallet 

and his boss was a dumbass 
and his buddy told him he doesn't want to be his friend anymore 

I asked him if he wanted to grab a bite 
he said no at first, but I insisted 

we went to McDonalds 
and hung out for a bit 

it was good to talk 
and eat that food 

I tried not to talk about myself too much 
but sometimes I got carried away 

I was trying to show him I related to what he was going through 
even though it was different 

its good to have a bite to eat 
and compare notes 

I wouldn't mind catching up with the Mink again 
down the road 

he's a good guy 
and I don't think his buddy should have ditched him SKULL SOUP

there were three long pieces of painter's tape set out in a row on the ground 
the sticky side faced upward
and each of them had eighteen french fries stuck onto them 
one was from McDonalds, one was from Burger King and one was from Carl's Jr

some guy was riding his bike along the sidewalk and ran over them 
they got tangled up and went into his wheel 
he rode all the way home
and when he got off his bike he was angrier than he ever had been in his life 

he wanted to know 
how the hell all of that greasy fry tape got stuck into his wheel 
he tossed his bike onto the lawn 
and was too worked up to even untangle the tape 

he went inside and his wife was happy to see him 
he started yelling at her and ranting about what had happened 
she looked out the window and saw his bike there 
he went upstairs and slammed the door 

she sighed and went outside
she wheeled his bike into the garage and went upstairs 
she quietly opened the door and he looked away from her 
she stood there 

she asked him how work was 
he told her he didn't want to talk about it 
she sat on the bed and put her hand on his back 
he said that it wasn't fair 

he had a meltdown and said that he didn't even want that bike anymore 
and that it was all bullshit 
his entire life
was all bullshit 

and then he began to cry 
she sat there and listened to him
until he stopped 
and then she told him that he was right 

his job was stupid 
and that he wasted his life 
she said she wished she never married him
and that he should kill himself 

he knew she was right 
and he asked her if she would help him do it
she said no, he had to do it himself 
she was busy 

she went downstairs and sat on the couch 
she turned on the tv and read an ebook on her ipad 
eventually she got tired 
and went upstairs 

he had hung himself and was dead 
idiot, she said
she dragged him down into the kitchen 
and butchered him into pieces that she could manage

she froze his legs and arms and his torso 
but she put his head into the crock pot 
and now she is boiling a stock 
to make skull soup 
MUD

the frog jumped off a toolbox
and into the mud 

a kid lit a wasp's nest on fire 
and ran away screaming 

a guy put his hand in the toaster
and held it there for as long as he could 

now he is staring at his hand 
and watching it blister 

he is thinking of when he was a kid 
and lit a wasp's nest on fire 

he is thinking about a frog he once saw jump off of a toolbox 
and into the mud 

he is unsure why he is thinking of these moments
he does not know why his brain is firing these random synapses 

he felt sure that there is no cumulative meaning 
but now he is second guessing himself 

because if he is so sure of that 
then how could that feeling of certainty be trusted 

he unplugged the toaster from the wall
and took it under his arm 

he walked to where he lit the wasp's nest on fire when he was a kid
and found only grass and wind 

he walked to the construction site
where he saw the frog jump off of the toolbox 

they'd blown a ditch in the concrete
and he could barely see past the fence they put up

as he stood there, he felt sentimental 
and remembered a song he heard on the radio every once in a while 

he didn't know what the name of it was 
but he hoped that one day he would hear it again 
MCDONALD'S COFFEE

I am sleeping 
in this moment 

I am dreaming 
of two types of potato chips 

I have woken up
sleeping on top of an air conditioner that I have never seen before 

half of my face is frozen 
and the other half feels sunburnt 

I have gone upstairs 
and realized I was in the basement of a McDonalds 

I got a hash brown and ketchup and a coffee 
for the walk home 

I am walking home now 
drinking this giant coffee 

I am wondering how I ended up in the basement of a McDonald's 
the last thing I remember before that 

was looking at my new desktop background 
and trying to remember something that I had forgotten to write down two days ago 

I know you might not believe that this actually happened but it did 
I'm not making things up for the sake of general interest 

I'm not just sitting here, day after day 
fabricating bizarre scenarios, for no reason 

I really am drinking 
this McDonald's coffee PERFECT SQUARES

I put on one of my old jackets today 
my wife had sewn a patch into the elbow a couple years ago 
the thread had come loose in the wash 

I pulled it and it came out
I cut it off but then it seemed like the rest of it was coming out too 
so I took out the thread and the patch 

if I wouldn't have picked at it 
it probably would have been okay 
but I was procrastinating my work a bit, and it got the best of me 

I feel upset that it came off 
since it was very kind of my wife to have fixed the elbow of my jacket 
I know she will say it's a strong reaction to something she could easily fix again 

I have the patch here
she cut it out from one of my old shirts
that shrunk too much in the wash 

it's not a perfectly cut square 
I guess my wife doesn't cut perfect squares 
maybe that's why I've got so damn sentimental looking at it 

I'm going to the grocery store now 
and my elbow may stick out of my shirt 
when I take a broccoli 
SODA

there are three types of pops 
can, bottle & fountain 
each is great in their own way 

it is difficult for me to think of my ultimate preference 
I will sit here and consider it 
please give me one minute to think about it 

I have looked within 
and found the answer 
my favourite is fountain 

I am remembering all the times I got a cup
from a restaurant and got to fill it up myself 
I've always had fun doing that 

there are no free refills when it comes to bottles and cans 
there is no sampling 
there is no ice 

that said 
I am always happy to have a can
or a bottle

tonight we are going out for dinner before the baseball game 
I don't know what kind of drink I will end up with 
but it might be a good idea to get a bottle 

(it might cost a bit more 
so I'll see if it's a rip off or not 
and then I will make my choice)

that way I can drink some at the restaurant 
some while we walk 
and then I can sneak it in and drink the rest at the stadium THE TERMITE'S ELBOW

the termites elbow
has shocked many of us 
to this day 

some people thought it was a piece of dead skin 
others didn't think it was anything
and others were in complete denial that anything was going on 

the termite had bit into a power line 
and had electricity running between its teeth 
endlessly 

the smell of a squid tentacle 
wafted into a cup of water
that was filtered from the ocean 

the map was made by a guy with a paint roller 
in a field 
and a wagon full of yellow 

I hope that everything will end up okay 
and that my behaviour does not piss off 
the people in my life 

to such an extent 
that they will never 
speak to me again 

I hope to make the right decisions 
so that we do not grow apart 
in the end 

somehow it seems that the choice 
has already been written in stone 
and that it isn't anyones to make 

because generally speaking 
people are stubborn assholes 
that goes for me, and it goes for you 

and it goes for the guy with the paint roller in the field
and all of those people that were shocked
by the termite's elbow
A LOCAL HERO

this one guy I know 
has a pet glue trap 

and one day 
he accidentally dropped it into a bowl of ramen 

he was at the buffet 
and was feeling depressed 

looking at the potatoes under the heat lamp 
and the squid muffins on the tray 

his manhood was extended to such a degree 
that he had to tie it around his waist like a belt 

or else he would step on it 
or get it stuck on his pet glue trap or dipped in his bowl of ramen 

he felt ashamed of himself 
most of the time 

but he felt better 
when he was at the buffet 

that's why he was there 
so often 

this all might sound quite familiar 
–– he was in the papers last week 

a rattlesnake got into the buffet 
and started attacking everyone 

everyone was panicking 
but the guy knew what to do 

he undid his belt 
and fought the rattlesnake to the death 

he saved everyone 
at the buffet 

and now he is a local hero 
of our neighbourhood 

I still don't know what to make of his pet glue trap 
but I'm glad that he saved the day 

that day
at the buffet 
I WILL NEVER TURN MY BACK ON SNOT

snot is awesome 
especially when it goes inside of an electrical outlet 

it's something that happened often 
in the house I grew up in 

there were snot fires 
in the walls 

I remember when we got our internet hooked up for the first time 
there was snot in our modem 

and it made our internet 
incredibly fast 

nowadays, when our internet isn't working well 
I try snotting it out 

but it doesn't really work 
with today's technology 

nowadays 
there are a lot of people logged into the internet 

and hardly any of them care 
about snot 

but I've never forgotten it
even in the face of disaster 

of drought, of famine, of tyranny and of pests 
I will never turn my back on snot 

it's who I am 
it's home 

THE CRUMBS REMAIN

sometimes I forget to write people back 
with a text message 

sometimes I don't know what to say 
so I wait a couple of days 

I hope they don't think that I don't care
or that I forgot 

sometimes there are crumbs on my desk 
the crumbs remain 

and I leave them there for a few days 
because I like them, for some reason 

like an unanswered text message from a friend 
I know I should write back, but I like leaving it there 

I'm not sure how to explain that
within the context of it all 

I hope I don't piss anyone off 
for the most part

and that I don't end up leaving any more friendships 
in the dust 

but sometimes it happens 
and there isn't anything to do about it 

and you have to crunch some toast around 
and scatter some new crumbs CAR WASH

we ate a chocolate bar in the car wash 
I'd got it on sale at the grocery store

it was ordinary 
and went well 

it was nighttime when we got out of the car 
so we couldn't see how good of a job it did 

but it seemed shinier 
than usual 

maybe it was just the moon 
and the streetlight 

I hope it doesn't look so good 
that we get robbed

tomorrow, in the day 
I will go check it out 

I will see 
about that bit of rust 

I will see 
about that goo above the headlight 

the truth is 
I don't mind a few imperfections 

in fact I'd prefer a few 
because like I said 

if it looks too good 
we'll probably get robbed 

and my mother in law's dog blanket 
is in the back seat 

and I think my good screw driver 
is in the trunk 

I'd hate to lose all that stuff 
that would be a piss off THE FM DIAL

the iguanasphere 
had no bearing on my consciousness 
until I considered it, this afternoon

I suppose I have begun to wonder 
about the virtue 
of the pathetic hero 

who does nothing to redeem themselves 
and was never very good at anything in the first place 
there is no function of that hero 

when one mouse is caught 
the next arrives 
looking identical 

when they enter the iguanasphere 
their stubbornness clouds their logic to such an extent 
that they die eating peanut butter 

I know there is more to say about it 
but that is all I need to talk about 
for my purposes, in this moment 

as well, I must say
that I have a song stuck in my head
and the words are mixed up, it says

–– and in another year 
some things will disappear 
and I will see you in a while crocodile 

perhaps you 
might recognize it 
from the FM dial 

perhaps you won't 
either way 
it's fine AT LEAST A HUNDRED BUCKS

this random guy was standing in his garage 
looking at all of his crap 

he knew he should clean the place up 
but he felt paralyzed by the sentiment 

of all the crap he had accumulated 
over the years 

it was truly all worthless garbage 
but he couldn't let it go 

his neighbour walked by 
and asked him what he was up to 

he told his neighbour he was cleaning the garage 
and the neighbour laughed at him 

he felt sad that his neighbour did that 
and he began to cry 

his neighbour asked if he was alright 
and he explained what was going on 

his neighbour told him to give him fifty bucks 
and he'd handle it for him 

so he did
he gave him fifty bucks 

and he stood there 
and watched as his neighbour threw all of his crap into the trash 

they drank some club sodas 
and didn't have much to say to each other after that 

it was a bad idea all around 
and they both knew it 

he wished he still had all of his sentimental crap 
and his neighbour knew

that he should have charged at least a hundred bucks
for doing all of that work PRIMORDIAL TAILSPIN AND DOLPHIN SQUARES

yesterday, some guy left his underpants in the trees
and was crying his head off outside of the grocery store 

the day before that, he was just a graphic designer 
with no motivation to go onto his computer 

his girlfriend was sick 
of his annoying depression 

so she dumped him 
she didn't have the patience anymore 

even with a bachelor's degree in social work 
and a master's degree in social work 

she still didn't have the patience 
he begged her to change her mind 

but she was very stubborn 
and wouldn't take him back 

he thought that she was the one 
but apparently he was wrong 

that is how he wound up in a primordial tailspin 
out in the middle of nowhere 

there were dolphin squares on his underpants 
and he gave himself a massive wedgie while running face first into a tree 

there was always something strange about getting hit on the nose 
it was like it knocked him out for a brief moment 

and combined with how it felt for his underpants to rip across
his butt 

he felt some momentary relief 
but still 

he couldn't shake how bad he felt 
and he cried in the grocery store 

by the empty fish counter 
they were closing soon 

and they'd already cleared the fish out
for the night 

I hope that eventually he will feel a bit better about things 
it will take time 

but eventually 
he will feel betterTHE EXPRESS HOTEL

I am hoping to get a room at the express hotel 
when I go on my upcoming business trip

it is near the convention center 
and they have a great restaurant 

the coffee is piping hot 
and the breakfast isn't too badly overpriced 

it's remarkable 
how little bullshit there is 

some people like bullshit
but I for one, do not 

if there is bullshit 
I will get pissed off 

I want to bring my cat there 
I think he would love it  

he also hates bullshit
he doesn't tolerate it at all 

ever since he was a kitten 
if he saw any bullshit 

he would lift his paw 
and extend his claws

we are the same 
me and him 

we are best friends 
and every day I get to spend with him 

makes me feel 
extremely lucky 

and now that I think of it 
I don't think I'm going to go on that business trip after all 

I would rather stay home 
with my cat 
MAX & MAX

I saw something strange when I was driving 
today 

a loaf of bread 
trotting along the sidewalk

I pulled over 
and followed it 

I caught it 
and saw 

that there was a chihuahua
who had climbed into a loaf of bread 

what the hell man
I said 

the cars were wizzing past 
it began to rain 

you need a lift somewhere
I asked him 

he barked 
I picked him up and tossed him in the back seat 

the bread had got all wet 
and got all over the place 

I took him to the pound 
and they said that they knew this dog well 

his name was Max 
and he was constantly getting in trouble 

they said that he escaped every cage and kennel 
they ever put him in 

they said they once tried to put him down 
and he escaped the needle 

I looked over at Max 
and I had an idea 

I told them I knew a guy that might be able to take him 
they said, sure 

I drove him over to my buddy's house 
and explained the story to him 

he said, that he was thinking about getting a dog 
and that it was all quite the coincidence 

I told him that it wasn't a coincidence 
and that he told me two days ago that he was thinking about getting a dog and that's why I was there 

he scratched his head and tried to remember
do you want him or not? I asked 

alright, he said 
good, his name is Max

that's my name, 
he said 

I know 
is that a coincidence or did I tell you that too? he asked 

it's a coincidence 
I said 

but I told you my name was Max 
right? 

yes
I said 

so? 
he said 

I told him I'd see him later
and I went back to my car
THE WAKE OF THE BLINTZ IS ERRONEOUS

the wake of the blintz 
is erroneous 

from any perspective 
including from a llama's ass 

et cetera 
a can tab 

there are two villains 
one 

is an imbecile villain 
and the other 

is 
a non imbecile villain 

it is probably good 
in the end 

to be a non imbecile villain 
that way 

you can know 
that gave it your all 

you were a great villain 
and you were awesome 

I would suggest 
becoming a villain 

you don't have to tell anyone 
that you're doing it

but you should at least give it a shot 
for a little, because

the wake of the blintz 
is erroneous 

from any perspective 
including from a llama's ass 

a can tab
et cetera ASSHOLE FLESH

I will look back at some point 
and think that things were good, now

I am not claiming to be gracious 
it is just the truth 

otherwise I have not noticed much 
and I am in good spirits 

a doorknob squeal has become turnip fodder 
a tea bucket has become the asshole flesh 

that a guy transplanted 
into his ear 

someone senselessly shot him in the cartilage 
he is lucky not to have tinnitus 

in his ear
but he does have it in his ass 

he has relentless and untreatable ass tinnitus 
but still he has managed not to be miserable 

he is a well natured man 
always has been SELF PORTRAIT

translating the fog 
vacuuming the dust 
and looking at the fuzz 

it is sad to see dead animals on the road 
their teeth puncturing the tires
of the cars and the trucks 

some guy took a dead animal 
and tried to invent a new flavour 
of sparkling water with it 

he is calling it pomegranate grapefruit 
and there is a cartoon of a racoon on it 
there are coupons online 

I tried some 
I wish I hadn't 
but I did 

I couldn't say no to the sale 
and now I'm someone who drinks 
roadkill soda 

it's who I am 
I am carpet dust 
I am fuzz mold and ass fog

ass fog 
meaning 
a passing fart 

that some guy had 
when he was scooping off roadkill 
to make soda from 
CHICKENS OF THE ALCOVE I

I am thinking of inventing 
a virtual reality game 

called 
the chickens of the alcove 

in the game
you will see chickens in your house 

and you will have to get their eggs 
and then 

you have to make eggs
scrambled, fried, poached

omelettes, 
boiled 

the game 
and the chickens 

would be loved by many 
it would become a classic 

I just went and walked around the house
and I've begun to have second thoughts

on one hand I think it would be a lot of fun 
to have chickens running around 

but on the other hand 
I know that people might not take the idea seriously 

they might laugh at it 
and think that it's dumb 

I came close to deleting this idea 
thinking of all those people and what their criticisms might be

but then I realized 
that they don't even exist 

they are nothing in comparison to 
the chickens of the alcove CHICKENS OF THE ALCOVE II

a strange cloud like effect 
I cannot see well 

sitting in a chair 
ordinarily 

a microscopic issue
has come from the wall 

and arrived in front of me 
it is a floating white fleck 

it has small evil teeth
like a chicken skeleton 

it seems as though the virtual reality chickens 
have escaped 

and they are eating my ankles 
and feet 

I might be dead 
I cannot tell 

it seems as though I may have stepped into hell 
with these chickens 

at least there is little to no gravity 
where I am CHICKENS OF THE ALCOVE III

I had realized then 
that I was on a plane to hell 

there was a woman that put her cowboy hat 
in the overhead compartment 

I vomited on takeoff 
into the little bag 

and while the plane was diagonal
I had massive diarrhea 

I had no feet
only ankles with jagged bones sticking out 

the cowboy hat woman gave me a pack of gravel, which I didn’t expect
I couldn’t tell if she was wearing that hat as a joke or not 

but this was not the actual hell 
the actual hell 

are the thoughts I have caught in my brain 
saying that I am a failure 

the chickens on the horizon look familiar 
they look my mother and father and my two sisters 

in hell 
I am having dinner with them 

and my wife is not there 
and they think I am pig shit and vomit 

we are here now 
at the hotel 

my wife 
and me 
CHICKENS OF THE ALCOVE IV

things have become quiet, here in hell 
I am eating toast 

the grass has become beige 
and the skyline is empty 

except for the moon 
it is massive even in the daytime 

there is a small coffee shop 
about fifteen minutes away 

there are two signs on the door 
one says that they are short on staff so please be patient 

and the other sign says 
now hiring

we went in to order some teas 
and saw five chickens working 

I thought that was excessive for such a small coffee shop
in the middle of nowhere

but then we saw on the menu 
that they had introduced a new fried chicken sandwich 

and we understood 
the meaning of the signs on the door 

we walked home along the beige grass, drinking our teas
passing six hotels until we got to ours 

I lay down to watch tv 
and then had a liquid fart 

there was no covering it up 
so I had to explain it to my wife 

she called the front desk and told them we spilled coffee on the sheets
the housekeeper came to replace them 

she was kind at first 
but her attitude changed

when she saw the tea labels 
hanging from our cups 

she knew that the stain wasn’t coffee
after all CHICKENS OF THE ALCOVE V

I will try to make peace with the chickens
here in hell, for now 

I have realized I am only an illusion in their world, 
like at one point, they were in mine 

I will try to mind my business 
and eventually will find a way back 

it is possible to escape hell 
I've done it before 

but somehow 
I always end up back here 

somehow
it feels like home THE WELL OF DOOM

the well of doom 
was in fact a place of immense inspiration 

some crumbs had fallen off an everything bagel
sesame seeds, poppy seeds, dried onion flakes 

melted cheese 
was doomed to melt

cheese melted in the sun
cheese melted in the microwave 

liquid cheese 
and dried liquid cheese 

I am unsure what I am saying 
exactly 

but it is a jovial 
time 

and I am especially happy 
in this moment 

to be sitting at the computer 
here

and getting the time 
to write some things down 

I am not looking down the well of doom 
at the moment 

instead 
I am looking at some passing cloud 

that has broken up
the sun

but do not think 
I will forget 

the main attraction 
my profession 

looking down 
the well of doomFROM THE GARDEN TO THE ROAD

a turnip snail fast forwards 
from the garden to the road 

the impatient creature has made no sacrifice 
nor should it 

remain oblivious 
remain inside of a tape measurer 

have access to your email inbox 
at all times 

I do not mean to stress 
the modern day of it all 

the dumb part 
is obvious 

a turnip snail 
fast forwards through the dirt 

from the garden
to the road

checking its email 
obsessively 

but there is no shortcut 
and there is no escape 

there is only the dirt 
along the path 

from the garden to 
the road

EXCELLENCE HIDING IN SNOT

something 
at the end

past the point where anyone can see it 
including me 

it has become compulsory 
to imagine the limit of my thoughts 

and then 
think past them 

or else 
everything will be obvious 

and I don't think 
that will help 

anyone
or anything 

perhaps there is a lamb 
standing beneath a streetlamp

perhaps there is an inanimate shadow 
reflecting off its own ass 

there is always excellence 
hiding in snot

I have said it before
and I'll say it again 

there is always excellence 
hiding in snot 

a lamb standing beneath a streetlamp
an inanimate shadow reflecting off its own ass 

I think you know what I mean 
and if you don't 

that's okay too 
you'll be okay
THE WHEELHOUSE OF FORTITUDE

the wheelhouse 
of fortitude 

is abysmal 
without suffering 

a skunk
unfortunately has died 

and its organs are there 
on the road

I know that a mouse ran off with its spleen 
but the opossum got its stomach 

you see
inside of its stomach 

was a mouse
that the opossum was hunting for hours

when that skunk came in 
and stole it for himself 

so when the skunk died
the opossum was there to get that mouse back 

justice
revenge 

not necessarily 
in that order 

I must return to the notion 
of the wheelhouse 

the wheelhouse of fortitude 
is abysmal without suffering 

said the mouse 
and now I understand his sentiment 

but I am left wondering 
something 

and I'm sure you are thinking it 
as well

who killed the skunk 
and was it the opossum

or could it have been 
the mouse

after
all

THE IGUANA

dried toothpaste 
in the sewer 

cat food
that the cat didn't like 

sardines 
swim free 

through sewage
dead or alive

some kid's pet iguana 
jumped into the drain

he had no idea 
what he was doing 

but he will be missed
by the kid 

he lived in his room
by his bed

did the cat eat him 
instead of his cat food 

did the iguana escape 
without even realizing it 

that poor kid
lost his pet iguana 

he will always remember him 
for the rest of his days 

he loved that iguana and now he must grieve 
but he does not know how 

and when he spits his toothpaste into the sink 
he does not know that's where his iguana went 

instead the kid will sit at his desk
and write a letter to his iguana 

he will write that he misses him 
on a piece of paper 

the kid went downstairs 
and spoke to his mother 

he told her that he needs to start doing drugs
to handle the loss

she does not know how to respond 
and she is slowly panicking 

she is thinking about what the kid said constantly 
even when she is dumping sardines down the sink 

because the cat won't eat them 
he is an unbelievably picky cat 

as I sit here 
I realize 

the mother's worry 
is entirely frivolous 

and the kid's pain was entirely frivolous 
there is no and never was an iguana 

I am sorry for bothering you 
with this 

but still I am sad
about it all 

I am sad for the kid
and the mom 

and the sardines 
and the cat 

and the tooth paste and the sewage
and the iguana EAT FOOD WATCH TV GO FOR A WALK

I am looking forward 
to eating a sandwich tomorrow 
for lunch 

I am looking forward 
to dumping a bottle of mustard
onto the plate 

I am looking forward
to eating some french 
fries 

I will sit on the couch 
and read the news 
and finish the book I am reading 

I will feel lazy
and bloated
from eating the sandwich 

and then I will watch some tv shows
and maybe I will nap
and eventually go for a walk 

it is boring 
and ordinary 
and good 

I imagine a lot of people 
are going to be doing 
what I am 

it is true
that some guy 
will get murdered tomorrow 

and another guy 
will accidentally 
die 

I doubt I will be either of those guys 
but I suppose 
you never know 

regardless
I am not going to live tomorrow 
like it is my last day on earth 

but now that I think about it 
even if it was
I don't know if I'd do anything different 

eat food
watch tv 
go for a walk 
DYING IN MUSTARD

he was a fly who died in mustard 
he was a celebrated pilot, he was a revolutionary 

he flew through the salt mines 
in the 2015 war

he was both a capitalist 
and a socialist

he understood 
that they were both good 

his favourite joke 
was misogynistic and racist 

and he laughed his ass off
every time he told it 

and there he was now, dying 
his wings twitched, he buzzed in a circle 

smearing mustard across the table 
buzzing 

his name was Hershey the fly 
and I will remember him dearly 

I know that he would be happy 
dying in mustard

it was his favourite sauce
after all IT IS GOOD TO BE MUNDANE WHEN IT IS TIME TO BE MUNDANE

a turtle shell 
a paint roller 

a turtle with no shell 
a paint roller brush 

I am unsure 
if they are equivalents 

it may be the opposite 
it is good to be mundane when it is time to be mundane 

I was cutting onions today 
powering through 

I had a brief consideration 
that there may be a guy out there 

who chops onions 
with his erection! 

and instead of crying 
I have no idea what kind of tears he has 

I did not share that thought 
with my wife or mother in law 

as they sat on the couch 
on the other side of the room

talking about 
how the day went 

I will say this 
for the turtles and the house painters 

of the world 
I suppose it is true that 

it is good to be mundane 
when it is time to be mundane TOSSING SODAS AT THE WALL

I was standing on a soda can
but it wouldn't crush 

so I stomped on it 
and still it wouldn't 

so I went and took a massive hammer 
and then a sledge hammer 

but I couldn't get it to crush 
so I tossed it at the wall

and it exploded
and created a massive portal 

I went into the portal 
and saw eighteen giraffes 

tangled up 
and screaming 

what the hell 
I said 

I tried to untangle them 
but I couldn't 

I told them to stop screaming 
so I could think up a plan 

but they wouldn't shut up
so I went back through the portal 

and then it closed 
and now I can't get back there 

I keep tossing sodas at the wall trying to get a portal to open 
but it isn't working 

I keep hearing them 
the screaming giraffes

their purple tongues 
wailing and flickering like candle flames 

I wish that I could help them 
but I don't know if I will be able to 

almost twenty minutes have passed 
and I am thinking about it still 

but I have come up with nothing 
so that's all I can say for nowSPORTS DRINK, BATHMAT FACTORY

the bathmat factory 
was full of cockroaches 

and clinically depressed people 
and people who are depressed but do not have a formal diagnosis 

I don't know what they are thinking 
I don't know why they are there 

I was just walking down the street
for the first time in two days and I saw them all there

I was walking along 
and veered off to some path and there was the bathmat factory 

what the hell is with all of these bathmats 
and why were they lighting them on fire 

why is there a lightning bolt 
zapping the same guy over and over again 

why are there so many cockroaches 
walking into the incinerator 

why are these people so depressed 
and obsessing over the lost and found box 

I need to get home 
I am sick of being here in this bathmat factory 

on the way home 
I might stop and get a sports drink 

I'd rather not spend the money 
but I'm pretty thirsty 

and sometimes there is a deal
if you buy two 
THE HELL OF IT ALL

yesterday there was a kid's hat on the ground
a winter hat 
not a toque 
but the kind with long ears and a string to tie 

and today I saw it again 
but someone had moved it 
off of the sidewalk 
and onto a ledge

you could see they put it there 
and dusted it off 
because they knew what it was like 
to lose a good hat like that 

when I saw it there
I remembered the dream I had 
between these two hat 
sightings 

I dreamt that my sister
and her husband
got two pitbulls 
and you've got to understand something

you've got to understand
that she's got a one year old 
and a 
damn yorkie 

I remember walking down the street
seeing the hat
and remembering the dream 
and I remember the dream 

I have the intelligence 
of an inchworm 
I have the intelligence 
of an inchworm who is a genius 

an inchworm 
who escapes dream pitbulls 
and moves hats 
just so 

an inchworm 
who moves hats 
in a way that expresses 
the peak of human kindness 

I am the inchworm 
who eats apples
in a way you only thought 
exist in cartoons 

I am an inchworm 
who is floating in soda water
for no good reason 
I'm doing it, just for the hell of it all THE SODA

a can of soda 
launched from a slingshot 
floating across the sky 

some guy 
was standing around 
and almost got smoked in the head 

what the hell 
he said 
he looked at the soda on the ground 

there was no one around 
he didn't know 
who tossed it 

there was no bird in the sky 
there was no one around
anywhere 

he looked through his binoculars 
and checked his heat radar tracker device 
but he didn't see anything 

it was a soda he didn't recognize 
a sugar free 
cola 

he cracked it open 
and it exploded
and fizzed all over the place 

it got all over his hand 
he extended his arm and held it outward 
so it didn't get on him 

still he cursed 
and switched the soda into his other hand 
while he shook the other hand off 

he drank the soda 
and relaxed 
he thought that the soda was good 

and eventually 
he went back to wherever he came from 
home presumably COFFEE

I don't want to think about any bullshit 
at the moment 

I am unconcerned 
and complacent 

I am good 
all around 

slightly irritated 
though 

I am thinking of a fake halloween crow
that was taped to someone's house 

I don't want to think of any animals 
as metaphors 

I would like to watch tv 
and then sleep 

I want to wake up tired
so that the coffee is great 

I would say 
that drinking coffee 

is my favourite thing 
to do 

of all 
time 

on the last day of my life 
lying in a hospital bed

I will drink the last cup
and it will be 

really
something

to know 
that was the last cup 

I don't even care 
if it's a bullshit cup

I'll still drink it 
I'll take whatever they haveCOFFEE II

I am trying to understand 
what I am scared of 
when it comes to sharing my writing 

perhaps 
the thought 
is that every single person on earth 

will be disinterested 
and think 
it is dumb, at best 

the insecurity 
has not changed 
for as long as I can remember

the antidote 
for some years
was to try to make it was perfect 

I would work 
and whittle it down 
to a matchstick 

and then look at the matchstick 
and see that it wasn't great 
and then toss it out

without even 
having 
tried to light it 

the match metaphor 
may be a bit melodramatic 
but I will say 

that lately
I have been messing with a barbecue lighter 
and its going alright 

I still haven't totally figured out 
the child safety lock
but it's starting to make more sense 

what I think 
I have realized 
now 

is that insecurity 
will never go away 
it has always been there 

and there is no antidote 
it is 
never going to leave 

ok
good
I guess that's it 

I am imagining drinking coffee 
on my deathbed 
and feeling pleased about all of the time I sat and worked on my writing 

regardless 
of every mother fucker 
on the planet 

I am imagining drinking coffee
on my deathbed
and feeling good about that COFFEE III

today I stopped in at the McDonalds 
and got a small coffee

I used the restroom 
it was in the basement

it seemed like a plausible location
to get murdered 

it has been a while 
since I have been somewhere that felt like that 

but there was no one there 
I took a piss and left

I got my coffee 
and stood on the street and drank it 

it was nice out 
I was not overwhelmed by any particular emotion 

but 
I am nostalgic for that moment 

and it was only 
six hours ago

there were many leaves on the ground 
and I was not dead 

I was not in the moment then 
but I am now 

I didn't even finish the coffee
I had to toss it out in the end 

because it was too late in the day 
and I didn't want to fuck up my sleep 

that is the thing 
about deathbed coffee

no matter how late in the day it is 
I will finish that one 
SWEEPING THE CAVE

a slug
in the cave 
is pointless 
to mention 
at this point 

but what about the smoke alarm 
that was hidden 
beneath the lasagna noodle
that was stuck 
to the ceiling 

I am standing beneath it 
watching the flash of light 
pass through the noodle 
it has begun beeping 
there is a low battery 

but that slug 
could be the battery 
I have to capture that slug
and put it inside of the smoke alarm 
or else the beeping will never end 

shark fin ice cream 
that is what has become of it all 
it is as the saying goes 
I don't remember which saying 
but you know what I mean 

it is too late now
I have mentioned the slug 
I have mentioned the lasagna noodle
I have mentioned the smoke alarm 
and I have mentioned the shark fin ice cream 

I am going to come back to the cave later
with a power washer
I tried sweeping it out 
but the entire floor is dirt 
I cannot sweep up the dirt, if the floor is dirt 

that's it 
that was the saying I forgot
I cannot sweep up the dirt, if the floor is dirt
I knew it would come back to me 
it always does 
THE PARKING COP

there were leaves on the windshield 
some of them caught in the wiper 

as I drove onto the highway 
they all started blowing off, except for one 

and then I saw what the hell it was 
those weasel bastards put a damn yellow piece of paper under my windshield 

I've got a permit 
for christ's sake man 

I went to the grocery store
and bought the gluten free matzoh ball mix 

tomorrow evening we will have the soup 
made by my mother in law 

and if that parking cop comes back 
before then 

I will tape a yellow piece of paper to his head 
and rob him of thirty bucks 

if he's not a complete 
weasel bastard 

then he can come in 
and have some soup 

but if not 
I'll tell him to take a hike 

next time 
he'll think twice 

before putting trash 
under our windshield wiperWIRE INTO THE LIZARD BRAIN

I have realized 
a technical issue 

in order to write 
in the way I see fit 

it is important to disassociate 
from self criticism 

to let the ideas 
arrive through the antenna 

and set them up 
in whatever way 

when the antenna is extended 
it can be difficult to control impulses

therefore
looking at stupid shit online 

therefore 
needlessly trimming stray whiskers 

therefore 
getting distracted 

in order to let the mind wander
you have to let your guard down and become an imbecile 

I'm not talking about editing or revisions 
just getting the ideas down 

you have to become a numbskull 
and wire into the lizard brain 

still 
at the end of the day 

the words arrive 
and the pages pile up 

and despite whatever happened 
the work gets done 

I will continue to try 
to be an idiot 

because somehow it seems 
like the right thing to do 
CONSIDERING SNOT

blowing snot 
from my nose 

trying to get 
to the end of it 

I have no idea 
what the point of snot is 

I have found myself 
picking my nose more lately

usually 
when I am reading 

years ago 
I smoked cigarettes 

but now 
I just pick my nose 

it is what it is 
I don't know what else I can say about it 

when I was a kid 
sometimes I'd wipe some snot on the bottom of a desk 

I haven't done that in a long time 
even before I quit smoking cigarettes 

maybe one day 
I'll do that again 

wipe some snot 
on the bottom of a desk somewhere

for old time's 
sake STALACTITE DREAM PUFFS

the qualm 
of the insignificant 

has been long disputed 
in the name of stalactite dream puffs 

this much cannot be emphasized or mitigated 
in any regard 

it simply is a fact 
like a paint roller in dog shit 

like some idiot 
who was painting his house 

and got dog shit 
on his paint roller 

and now the whole house 
smells like shit 

in all honesty 
I'm not surprised 

there's no getting that smell out 
they tried everything 

and the whole block still smells like dog shit 
and the guy is on the brink of suicide 

but he's started seeing a shrink again
hopefully that makes a difference 

I don't really know what anyone else can do for him 
I would tell him to read some non-fiction books 

I think that might help him
if anything 

I know that he reads a lot of fiction 
and clearly 

that isn't helping him 
at all 

it seems clear 
that those books 

are only making things 
worse MICROWAVED DOG SKELETON

a pointless moment 
sitting near an air conditioner 

I looked up a word 
that I thought I knew the definition of 

but then I realized 
it doesn't really mean 

what I thought it did 
after all 

I may have crawled into the microwave 
and cooked myself down to a dog skeleton 

I am a microwaved dog skeleton 
running down the street 

beneath cars
through intersections 

onto the subway 
and in a subway restaurant 

eating all the deli meats 
in the storage room 

after this I'm going to go live in the forest 
I think it will be better there 

I will eat fish from the river 
and sleep in for as long as I want 

I hope I will still be respected
if I accomplish nothing 

and do my own thing 
from now on 

I am always slightly worried 
that I will lose the respect 

of literally everyone on earth 
I don't know why 

it is hard to imagine 
what it would be like 

not to be insecure
I don't know 

if non insecure people 
truly exist 

perhaps I will set my mind 
to becoming a secure person 

perhaps I will set my mind 
to becoming 

a microwaved
dog skeleton HEDONISM

I'm mostly bald 
on the top of my head 

I used to feel bad about it 
but now I think it is better, than having too much hair 

I was hoping to be more productive today 
but I ended up watching comedy online, for longer than I should have 

it is easy to feel like a dumbass 
for doing that 

but then again 
I have to enjoy myself, every once in a while 

I don't think I'm a hedonist 
I would be ashamed if I found out I was one 

I know there are a lot of bald hedonists out there 
but I am a bald neurotic 

after dinner we went to the store 
and bought eggs on sale 

I got some soap 
and my wife got some kind of skin care thing 

I think it is probably soap too 
or maybe it was moisturizer 

I just got an email 
the dvd I ordered 

is on hold 
at the library 

maybe I will go and pick it up
tomorrow MEDIUM LEVEL IGUANA

a trash can lid 
on the ground 
next to a trash can 

an abbreviated 
medium level iguana 
going towards the trash that has spilled out from the trash can 

sometimes 
things stop being what they are 
and are only trash 

like banana peels
old newspapers 
and dvd's that are all scratched up 

I remember seeing that iguana 
standing on the dvd 
the neon beams reflecting all around him 

I know that it wasn't much 
just an image of an iguana 
but it was really something 

a giant asshole flew into the alleyway then 
and hovered above us 
from the right angle it looked like a flying saucer 

it then was about to expel 
a massive excremental turd 
but the iguana aimed the dvd reflection beam upward and destroyed it

rendering that thing off the planet 
and
constipating it forever 

that iguana 
who you thought was just some random guy 
actually made a difference that day 

I hope that will make people see 
the proverbial heroism 
of the medium level iguana 

I don't know if it will 
in fact I'm almost sure it won't 
but I suppose you never know what will happen 

maybe 
it's worth 
a shot 
ONLINE CHESS

I moved my pawn to G6 and killed his pawn 
and then he took that pawn with his pawn 

I moved my queen up to F7
he moved his queen to D7

I moved my rook to H3, putting him in check 
and that was it, I won 

and I'll tell you something 
he's a damn good player 

at the end of the day 
I think he's a better player than me 

but I kicked his ass 
and it was a good checkmate 

if anyone wants to challenge me on the chess.com app 
my username is turtlecube3029 

I play every day 
against my buddies 

so, as user chessterfieldalberta always says 
see you on the squares
FOUR BAGS OF LIMESTONE

there is a hard drive in 
a cactus 

it is extremely hot out 
and the hard drive has melted to liquid 

some guy ran head first into the cactus 
I have no idea why 

he died instantly 
from the spike going into his head 

he had bad dandruff 
in that sun 

meanwhile 
I am sitting here 

playing internet chess 
and thinking about my own dandruff 

I have to buy four bags of limestone 
from home depot this week 

I don't know anything about limestone 
except that it is a rock 

I looked up a picture of it online 
I quite like it

it looks like a good rock 
it looks like a rock that I will be happy to buy four bags of CRUSTACEAN CLAW

a crustacean claw 
has clamped 
onto a guy's dickhole 

he was swimming 
in the ocean 
when it happened 

it looks like a crawfish 
but it could be some other 
crustacean 

it is inside of his swim trunks 
the antenna are poking out from the waist 
and the tail from the bottom of his shorts 

he is screaming bloody murder 
he is crying 
and no one knows what to do 

someone just yanked his shorts down 
and they are trying to get the crawfish off 
but they can't 

he might die 
I would imagine 
that would be a relief for him 

I suppose that kind of death
while excruciatingly painful
would be fast 

but I am unsure 
if I would prefer a fast death 
I may want to reflect a bit, knowing death was coming 

but that is the thing about death
it should be obvious 
–– it is always coming 

in that case I will have to reflect on my death 
not like there is a crustacean vice gripped to my dickhole 
more calmly than that 

––

I gave it a shot 
and I found that I was screaming 
with my underpants around my ankles 

like there was a crustacean vice gripped to my dickhole 
I understand that man 
better now HOME DEPOT

tomorrow 
I am looking forward 
to going to home depot 
to buy the limestone 

it is always good to go to that store 
I like looking around 
and thinking about the possibilities 
there 

if you are in home depot
you will see a strange saw 
and perhaps you will purchase it 
and bring it home 

from there 
I have no idea what you will do with it 
perhaps you can cut your own head off 
and glue it into your ass

I would keep the receipt 
just in case
they are pretty good 
about returning things 

I saw a guy walk in there once
he had his head glued into his ass
he returned a saw and a glue gun 
and they didn't even ask him any questions 

he just gave them the receipt 
and his credit card 
and they refunded it 
without any fuss 

it is like being in a library 
if you are there 
surrounded by the books 
eventually you will pick one up and start reading it

even if you are just there to nap 
or to wait out the cold 
you can pick up a book
and read it 

I would recommend going to the library 
when you have the chance 
even if you don't have time 
you should still go THEY ARE IN TWO DIFFERENT STRIP MALLS

there are pencil shavings 
and dust on the salmon 

a box of flaming pinecones 
next to the mixture of salmon cuts 

a combination 
drink, fries, hamburger 

the price will depend
on which combination you want

I often go for the value choice 
it is great to get a deal 

you may be wondering what the box of flaming pinecones has to do with anything
you may be wondering about the salmon cuts and the dust and the pencil shavings 

there is nothing to know 
there is no hidden meaning 

they aren't even in the same place
as the combination 

they aren't even in the same strip mall
they are in two different strip malls, four miles away from one another 

there is no connection 
there is no deeper meaning 

there is no pattern 
there is no wisdom 

there is nothing to understand
it is just pencil shavings, dust, salmon and flaming pinecones

all things considered 
it is, has and always will be –– a value choice THINKING ABOUT WORK

when I was younger 
I thought that work meant that something required an unprecedented amount of effort 

but I don't know if that's it 
anymore 

pushing a limit 
transcending a breaking point 

is usually a fun thing to do
and it is enjoyable to exert effort 

but I don't know 
if it's work 

work 
is the persistence of the mundane 

that is the task 
of someone who works for a living 

completing the same task 
over and over again 

in a few years 
I will reassess again 

but for now 
I hope that is reasonable enough THE GUY WHO MAKES THE EGG SALAD

Erwin, the guy who makes the egg salad
was sitting on a milk crate 

he was crying 
inconcolobly 

he didn't have to say why 
we all knew it was because his cat ran away 

it happens every few months 
and every time it does, he just loses it 

he still showed up for his shift and did his prep 
but then he just broke down 

after work a bunch of us went with him 
to help him look for his cat 

we searched everywhere 
but we couldn't find him

and at around ten p.m.
we had to call it 

at one point 
Erwin told me that he'd rather be dead 

than be away from his cat
I knew from the way he said it, that he wasn't lying 

I hope his cat comes back 
sooner than later 

___ 

I wanted to let you know
what happened

this morning when Erwin opened the kitchen 
he saw the vat of egg salad was tipped over 

he screamed fuck and kicked over the mop bucket 
but then he saw some paw prints in the egg 

it was the happiest moment of his entire life 
there was his cat, eating the egg salad 

everyone is really happy that things are 
okay 

Erwin is making a new batch of egg salad now 
it should be ready by the time we open BOSTON

a strange insecurity 
that I assume is pointless 

it is in my stomach 
or perhaps it is my stomach 

a feeling 
can have a physical attribute 

that is how you qualify it 
as more than a feeling 

I put on the song 
I am listening to it now 

if I never heard that song again 
it would be okay 

but I know I will 
that song will be listened to

in perpetuity 
for at least the rest of my lifetime 

the guitars sound good 
when they are congruent 

now if I'm honest 
I have to admit something 

the feeling that I was trying to describe earlier 
I think it might have resolved itself 

it was that damn song 
wasn't it A BOX OF GLUE STICKS, A HORSE'S ASS

a sheer and utter 
glue stick 

a turnpike 
a pickerel 

a box of glue sticks 
a horse's ass 

the mundane death 
of the pineapple pizza 

some other random thing
and another incongruent one 

a mundane deviation 
I think I know which shirt I am going to wear tomorrow the striped one 

a return to the sheer utter, glue stick, turnpike and pickerel 
some writing that I am still considering –– 

"what is desirable is congruity between your self conscious and your natural being. But there are those whose sanity flows from the conscious separation of those two things. If there even is a natural being, an irreducible self, it is rather small, I think, and may even be the root of all impersonation –– the natural being may be the skill itself, the innate capacity to impersonate, I'm talking about recognizing that one is acutely a performer, rather than swallowing whole the guise of naturalness and pretending that it isn't a performance but you. 
There is no you, Maria, any more than there's a me."

Philip Roth 
The Counterlife, 1986
THE WHISKER OF MINESTRONE

the whisker
of minestrone 

was taken 
and put between the two men 

they were in an argument 
one of them accused the other of farting near him while on the subway 

the other guy said that he didn't do it 
he said that guy was probably smelling his own ass 

everyone thought it was going to come to blows
but thankfully it did not get violent 

the guy said he was going to sue him 
for eight hundred dollars 

and that's when they went and spoke to the local rabbi 
who took the whisker of minestrone and put it between them 

he told them to look at the whisker 
and to say what they saw 

the fart accuser said that he did not want to say what he saw
the alleged farting guy said that he saw a tomato hair 

god damn it you idiots 
the rabbi said 

it's a minestrone whisker 
you fucking idiots 

the rabbi then told the accuser 
to write down on a piece of paper what the fart smelled like 

the guy did 
and the rabbi gave that piece of paper to a third party witness that had nothing to gain or lose from the result of the argument 

and then the rabbi told them each to go home 
and when they needed to fart, to put it inside of a plastic bag and bring it back the following day 

they each did that 
one of the guys had to stay up until three in the morning to catch a fart 

they returned the next day
and gave the rabbi the fart bags 

the rabbi smelled both of them 
and grimaced 

give me the paper 
he told the third party witness 

he read the paper 
it said, radish ass 

you say the fart smelled like radish ass? 
the rabbi asked him

yes
the accuser said 

I smelled no such thing 
said the rabbi 

the accuser did not know what to say 
he looked depressed 

the rabbi then gave him the minestrone 
and told him to sleep with his face in it 

and he gave the other guy the whisker 
and told him to put it on the subway tracks 

if they did these things 
all would be forgiven 

the men agreed to the terms 
and that was the resolution to their obscene conflict FLOATING IN HELIUM

my wife noticed something out the window 
there was a clitoris in a fartbag 

it was strange how it floated
I thought there must have been helium in it 

it was the day after the rabbi 
was settling that dispute between those guys 

I would imagine any god 
worth his salt 

would use a lot of helium 
–– it is a great practical effect 

my wife asked me 
what the point of circumcision was...

I told her it was because in the womb 
things were good 

but when a baby is born 
they had to know that things were not fair anymore 

I don't know if that's the actual reason 
maybe I will ask the rabbi

I wondered if there was ever a foreskin 
floating in helium 

I would wonder what it represented 
or what meaning could be derivedADVICE

my advice 
is to buy extra toilet paper 
when it's on sale 

my advice
is to buy extra noodles
when they're on sale 

my advice 
is to buy extra frozen pizzas 
when they're on sale 

it's a way of life
always looking at the sale stickers 
and it beats paying full price 

it's a good feeling 
knowing you've saved some cash 
and now you can spend it on something else 

we hardly ever buy anything full price 
it's boring 
and pointless 

I hope you'll consider my advice
and if you come across any good sales in the meantime 
make sure to let me know 

thank you 
and hope to see you 
sooner than later A GREAT ALLEGORY

I was sitting on the couch 
reading a book 

the dog was sitting there 
and he let one rip 

it smelled 
bad 

sometimes you are just sitting there
minding your own business 

and a dog farts 
next to you 

there's nothing to do about it 
it's just what it is 

one guy I was talking to 
recently 

was sitting on the toilet 
and he let out a fart so abrupt 

that it launched him into the ceiling 
and he had to be hospitalized 

he said it was a great allegory 
for life in general 

I didn't really understand what he meant by that 
but when the dog farted on me 

I think I might have understood 
I think what he meant 

was something similar to when people say 
–– that's life 

or –– shit happens 
or in his case –– 

sometimes you fart so badly 
that you rocket into the ceiling and bust open your damn head 

I just sat there 
and kept reading 

because at the end of the day 
what the fuck are you going to do THE FROG WILL RETURN

I was reading online 
about a frog that freezes for the winter 

I can imagine it in a way 
being that frog 

it must be sad, doing whatever it is you are doing 
and freezing like that 

thinking about all of the good things you got to experience in your life 
the leaves and the mud and the sun 

the river 
and the ripples in the water 

it wasn't long ago that it all began 
and now it is over 

even the snowflakes 
and the ice 

you appreciated them somehow 
despite everything, they had a way of slowing down time 

and they were there with you
during your time on earth 

all of the hope 
and every good meal

it all came together in that moment 
and now, you, the frog, are freezing to death 

the frog became ice
and it is beneath the snow, somewhere 

until one day it will become warm
and the frog will return againTOWN SQUARE QUAIL

the quail
swooped in and ate her husband's penis 

she was shocked 
she stood there, her mouth agape 

they were on their honeymoon 
she only settled down with him so that she could have kids before it was too late

and now 
it was all for nothing 

she watched the quail fly off
and disappear into the clouds 

blood spurt into her periphery 
but still, she stared blankly

he screamed and vomited on himself 
and ran into the water 

she walked away from the beach 
past the resort and into the town 

she stood in the town square 
and was surrounded by quail 
 
she didn't know where she was 
she didn't know why there were so many quail 

she didn't know why they were perched like pigeons 
shitting all over the town square 

she stood beneath them
staring upward 

and a memory occurred to her 
in the fourth grade 

she knocked over a thing of white out 
and it stained her desk for the rest of the year 

it seemed that life had a way of repeating itself 
it seemed that to her, life was merely a hellish vortex 

and that her only purpose 
was to suffer ALPHAGHETTI

a can of alphaghetti 
was poured into a saxophone 

and then the saxophone player 
farted into the saxophone 

and sent the alphaghetti 
flying 

it was the best gig they ever got
and that good for nothing saxophone player blew it 

that was their shot 
at the big league 

when asked why he did it
the saxophone player said 

that it was the call of the void 
he tried to explain what the hell he meant by that 

but no one knew what he was talking about 
so he was fired from the band

they have been trying to get their reputation back 
but the truth is 

they aren't that good 
without the saxophone player 

they know now that they shouldn't have fired him for doing that 
they should have just went with it 

but they made their choice 
and what's done was doneSLUG ELVES, ZIPLOCK SLIME

slug elves 
are the messiah 
of all time 

the salad
has come and gone 
it's green slime in a freakin ziplock 

not to mention 
the emoticon 
who was shot point blank for no reason 

the emoticon lived many lives before 
one of them was something 
that no emoticon could describe 

and now 
after dying as an emoticon there was nothing 
it was a permanent death 

where are the slug elf messiahs 
now 
that reincarnation, is no longer that 

now that condensed milk 
is the only thing on earth 
ever

there are only slug elves 
condensed milk, ziplocks of green slime 
and indiscernible emoticons 

even I am dead at this point 
when the slug elf messiahs 
arrived

there isn't much else to really understand 
one way or another 
it's just the way it went 

the slug elves 
are completely monotone 
but they will procreate 

hopefully not with the emoticons 
hopefully they will know what to do 
with the condensed milk and the ziplock slime 

I suppose we have to have faith 
that they will reincarnate the earth 
or else what kind of messiahs would they be

really
what kind of messiahs 
would they be
THE SLUG MESSIAH

the slug messiah 
was going along the road 
and saw a massive dead worm 

the slug messiah 
did not know 
what to do 

he had no idea 
how to bring a dead worm 
back to life 

I am a failed messiah the slug said
I am a piece of shit messiah 
I couldn't even save this worm 

the slug messiah 
felt depressed 
for a long time after that 

almost six days went by 
before he felt 
like he could face the world 

he went to the supermarket
and bought a cream soda 
and drank it on the sidewalk 

too bad about that worm 
god said 
the slug messiah nodded 

I hope you enjoy the soda 
god said
the slug messiah nodded again 

take it easy 
god said
and the slug messiah nodded 

hey wait
the slug messiah said 
to god

what? god asked him
I quit
the slug messiah said 

alright but you owe me for the snow tires god said
fuck those snow tires the slug said 
and god laughed at the slug THE SLUG MESSIAH II

the silk worm 
was sad 
and it was unable to articulate why 

its eyes were droopy 
and it felt like 
it had little connection to the others 

it was not a suicidal moment 
for the silk worm 
or even one that it felt like it would benefit from crying 

it was just sad
maybe 
for the hell of it 

the silk worm 
went to mcdonalds
and bought a medium coffee for one dollar 

it stood in the park 
and saw the slug messiah 
hopelessly staring at the dead worm 

the silk worm felt a bit better
when he saw 
how hopeless and depressed the slug messiah looked

and that is why god laughed when the slug messiah quit 
outside of the supermarket 
yesterday 

and it is why god never ended up 
making the slug pay for the snow tires
in the endTWIG MUCUS

a peanut twig 
and

octopus foreskin 
under the door 

twig chipotle 
twig mucus 

a whale
was stuffed into a hotel room 

twig mucus 
was jammed into the lock 

twig mucus 
was launched at the wall dingleberry 

it was depressing 
but no one did anything 

god put twig mucus 
on the ground 

so that lawnmowers 
would become benign 

and then 
people would eat twig mucus 

they would wear sweatpants constantly 
and die less often 

I did not expect to learn 
that anyone would ever ejaculate into a trumpet 

and try to say 
that it was twig mucus 

but people have been doing that lately 
and making tons of money off of it 

I don't think that's something 
that I will do 

instead 
I will eat ramen noodles

and take my book back to the library 
tomorrow morning TWIG MUCUS II

the exhaustion 
of six carrots 

has become the concern 
of the community 

they have realized something 
they have realized 

that twig mucus 
is the equivalent of a benign carrot stick 

I have no desire to help them
I only have a desire to eat potato chips while reading a book 

I will sit in my chair, or on the couch 
and I won't even open the news 

eventually I will fall asleep 
and nobody gives a shit about anything 

when 
they are asleep 

this wave of apathy hopefully will transpire 
into a bag of baby carrots 

I will order them to the house 
at an extremely high price 

when I wake up from the nap
I will get them

I hope a squirrel will not eat them 
when they are on the doorstep 

I don't know how long my nap will be 
so who knows how long the carrots will be there on the doorstep

if the squirrels want them
then fine, they can have them

go ahead squirrels
eat the baby carrots 

it's my gift 
to honour twig mucus TWIG MUCUS III: EAT PIZZA

the shopping cart 
was full 

of
twigs 

and
twig mucus 

I pushed it through the parking lot 
and the receipt went flying in the wind 

it was long gone 
it went into a cloud 

we drove home 
and on the way 

the car became totalled 
so we lit it on fire and walked home 

I will miss that old car 
I always thought that one day we would drive it to Montreal

but I guess I was wrong 
we will have to buy a new car now 

I think that will be the end of twig mucus 
at least I hope it is 

I know sometimes things seem pointless 
and truthfully sometimes they are 

but tomorrow we are making pizza for dinner 
I will look forward to it 

I will dream of it tonight 
when I am sleeping 

so there is that 
and if that isn't enough 

nothing ever is 
or will be 

believe in whatever the hell you want 
truly I could care less 

but 
eat pizza

I think 
that will be the conclusion of all of this 

eat pizza in heaven 
and in hell 

eat pizza
eat, pizzaTHE LINE

when I was a kid 
I can remember the best times 
were being alone 

and I can remember 
the worst times
were also being alone 

I saw it as a fault then 
but I can see now 
how important it is 

I don't want to bother you 
with talk about salamanders 
or beach garbage 

instead it may be good 
to sit quietly 
and try to be calm 

the world can seem very fucking incompetent 
at times 
but I realize, I am the through line 

I am on both ends 
of the line 
for better and for worse 

what is left 
is to try again tomorrow 
it's only a day away THE PEBBLE

the world's most valuable pebble 
was created 

from snot 
and diarrhea 

this was confirmed 
by someone who spelled penicillin with an s 

he said fuck you 
constantly 

he said it to children
and to old folks 

he said it to pregnant women 
and homeless men 

he drank McDonalds coffee
almost every day 

he was constipated 
for almost his entire life 

his wife brought him apple slices 
it was remarkable that he had a wife 

she thought that his theory about the pebble
was the stupidest thing she ever heard 

he asked her where rocks came from then
and she said not from snot and diarrhea 

but still he never said fuck you to her 
he would never say fuck you to his wife

he would say it to anyone, but not to her 
he was a man who loved his wife 

he loved her 
very much 
MCDONALD'S

I was chugging McDonald's coffee 
and thinking about stuff

I was standing outside of the McDonald's 
looking at my watch 

it can be difficult to get along with people 
but it is a good thing when it works out

I'm not the best at it 
but sometimes it works out 

the truth is 
I don't put that much effort in 

it is easy to feel bad about it 
self pity et all 

but the truth is 
I don't put that much effort in 

there are lots of different people at McDonald's 
some put the effort in, some less so 

I suppose it would be nice 
to go to McDonald's and have a coffee with a friend some time 

but for now I'm good on my own 
drinking my coffee GEORGIA

I once wrote about someone who was sitting on the toilet 
and they got launched upwards 
and knocked their head on the ceiling 

today I wondered 
if that could happen to someone 
who was sitting on a chair 

if they accidentally shit their pants 
to such an extent 
that they got launched upwards and knocked their head on the ceiling 

unfortunately 
it isn't outside the realm 
of possibility 

unfortunately 
I know someone it happened to 
her name was Georgia

she was just sitting on a chair 
looking at her cell phone 
she tried to pass what seemed like a small fart 

but then she shit her pants so violently 
that she was launched upward 
and slammed her head on the ceiling 

I'm glad there wasn't a fan there 
I'm glad she didn't get decapitated 
I'm glad that she is only suffering a mild concussion 

she cried a lot 
after it happened 
but she'll be okay 

truly it was a difficult day 
I found it hard to focus afterward 
but I still got some reading done after dinner 

I respect the decision to try to sneak a fart 
but know the risk 
know what can happen 
THE BRAN MUFFIN

the muffin 
does not give a single fuck 

fuck you world 
the muffin says 

he stands in the gutter for days
with his middle fingers held upwards 

cars honk at him 
and splash puddles in his face 

but the muffin 
does not give a single fuck 

he is a bran muffin 
that was tossed out of a truck window two weeks ago 

he has a bite taken out his head 
but still, he is persevering 

when squirrels come and try to eat his head he goes into the gutter
same with pigeons 

damn what I wouldn't do for a god damn cup of coffee
the muffin said 

so tomorrow he is going to go back to the coffee shop
and see if he can get a cup 

there is a strange sadness 
that he lives with 

he tries to weather it 
but it can be difficult

some days are better than others 
you never know when it will hit 

but tomorrow 
he will get that cup

he will risk it all 
for one last cup 

because that is who he is 
and he does not give a single fuck 
PAUL'S CUSTOM T-SHIRT

I have written an entire page
and deleted it 

I don't often do that 
but it seemed appropriate, today 

the ego wants to be cement 
but no one cares about the road 

if that means anything 
useful 

a stray dog runs across the road 
and disappears into the grass 

his owner is dead 
and now he is running 

meanwhile 
everything else is merely a screensaver 

if the mouse never moves 
it will go on forever 

I suppose it is good 
to think of these scenes 

and to let them exist 
on their own merit 

it is not for the ego 
it is because I am feeling better 

having written the page 
and not deleting it 

I am thinking of my old buddy Paul 
who once got a custom t-shirt made

it said narcs are fuckers 
in massive letters 

I don't know what reminded me of that t-shirt 
it just occurred to me, seemingly out of nowhereYOU IDIOTS, GO FUCK YOURSELVES!

I am trying to think of how I've been doing 
the past few days 

I am feeling some stress 
about bullshit 

some insecurity 
that I can't quite figure out 

I am not sure how to describe it 
I am sitting here trying to figure it out 

I haven't gotten to the bottom of it 
and its making me act like an asshole 

sometimes 
it is difficult, to relax 

I would say that its on the left side 
on my upper chest 

maybe there's an electric heater there 
that needs to get shut off 

any insecurity I have 
I would like to kill 

that is probably impossible 
but I will kill the thought of it

not with understanding 
or by nurturing it 

I will kill it 
by getting it to fuck off 

I want to be confident 
more than I want people to like me 

it seems that becoming comfortable 
with people not liking you is a good thing 

so I suppose I need to laugh in the face 
of the people that don't like me 

and thank them
for giving me confidence 

you idiots,
go fuck yourselves! ASS SPIDERS

I was at the doctor's office 
in the waiting room 

looking at photos of my wife 
and my cat 

she gave me a tetanus shot 
and said that I might feel a bit strange 

and now I am feeling a bit 
strange 

I thought of a spider 
spinning a web out of someone's ass and landing in the toilet 

I could blame the tetanus shot
but the truth, obviously, is that I would have thought of that anyway

I don't need a tetanus shot 
to think of a spider spinning a web out of someone's ass 

that's just what happens 
when I look at a toilet 

I've always meant to bring this up 
is it bad to piss on someone else's piss?

I hate when that happens 
when some idiot didn't flush the urinal 

and you don't want to touch the handle 
and you have to piss badly 

but looking at those pictures 
I felt grateful 

that's the best family I could have ever dreamed of 
there were a lot of times I was pretty sure I wouldn't get that figured out 

next week we're going on our honeymoon 
we've been married almost a year now 

it's going to be hard to be away from our cat 
but he'll be with my mom in law and two dogs and another cat 

it will be okay 
he will sit with them by the fireplace 

and if he sees any ass spiders
he will kill them dead
ENOUGH WORK

it can be difficult to relax
but sometimes 

it can be done 
if you can do enough work 

maybe ––enough–– isn't the answer 
maybe it's finding out how to do work 

that is 
fulfilling 

–– that's a tough thing 
to sort out 

but every once in a while 
I feel like it lands 

every once in a while
I catch a good one 

today 
I did ok

it wasn't perfect
but I think I did alright 

and alright 
is pretty good

all things 
considered GREEN LARD

last week 
I wrote a lot about –– insecurity 

it felt fucked to read it
but it had to happen 

now 
I am looking at that 

and I can see it 
as a jar of goop 

green lard 
AI semen, or something 

I feel like maybe I should keep it in the garage or something 
but I think I'll toss it 

I forgot to mention 
I went to the new library yesterday 

it was a good one
I sat and read a book for an hour or so

and then I went to a restaurant 
and ate fish and chips and caught up on my chess moves 

I suppose there's no point to that last part 
but I just wanted you to know that THE EAR CANAL SCAB

there is always a stick 
on the ground, or a rock 
to be found 

today 
has been strange 
more or less 

for no reason in particular 
perhaps dehydration 
or something like that 

in the end 
I did my exercises 
and am feeling alright 

I would like to make a video 
about the strangeness 
of ear hair 

perhaps when we return from our trip 
I will do that 
I will write it on a post it note –– ear hair 

what is the point of it
is it cool 
is it disgusting 

sometimes a single black one will sprout 
from a random place
but it seems that there are many white ones, growing from the canal 

and I think there is a dry scab in it 
I find myself picking at it 
when I read 

I suppose if I ever had to say,
definitively what life is
or was 

it would be exactly that 
reading and picking 
at the ear canal scabTHE ETERNAL PARADIGM OF THE NARCISSIST'S FREE SALAD

lettuce leaves 
in a bowl 

they have been washed
in the sink 

they are ready to eat 
they have salad dressing on them 

you can have it 
for free 

I hope you will enjoy 
the salad 

I hope you don't think 
I'm a narcissist 

but I suppose if you do 
then -- well -- I'm unsure what to do about that 

except offer
this free salad 

what a damn narcissist 
but that salad was good 

I had been eating so much trash 
that salad really hit the spot 

I should have a salad like that 
more often 

it helps with the constipation 
and the diarrhea 

the eternal paradigm 
of the narcissist's free salad HANDS AND FEET

now that Miriam is in her second trimester 
I am allowed to talk about it 

for the past however long, I have been compartmentalizing my attempts 
to write from the subconscious 

but that is neither here nor there
what matters 

is that we will have a baby girl 
she will be born in June, 2023

there's something that happens when I think about it
it's old tech ––

a surge of emotional something or other 
it kind of swells the eyes and connects to the chest 

it isn't overwhelming 
but it is –– whelming 

for now she is doing somersaults and the like 
I saw her in three dimensional black and white 

I saw her hands 
and her feetMY CAT

it seems there is nothing that causes me as much anguish 
than having to be away from my cat 

I know I often write a lot of bullshit
here

but 
the thought of being away from him for ten days... 

I feel like I am going to cry every minute 
and we haven't even left yet 

he will be at home with another cat, two dogs and my mom in law 
but still 

it's unbearable and I don't have the mental strength to handle it 
I should cancel the flight 

he is sleeping now 
on his chair 

I will miss him 
a lot VACATION

walking around 
& eating food 
CARTOON AT SHAKSHUKA RESTAURANT

we are walking around 
eating food 
and I am picking my nose every once in a while 

there was a cartoon on the wall of a restaurant 
I meant to take a picture of it 
but I forgot and now I have to remember it forever 

we were sitting on the beach 
and I noticed I had a massively long nipple hair 
it was coiled like a spring 

I don’t know if it is still there 
but regardless 
I am pleased with how things have turned out 
SCRAPS

there were a lot of people crowded around a giant menorah 
and some guy attached a blowtorch to a stick 
to light the candles 

meanwhile 
many people were watching the soccer game 
and we were eating a sabich sandwich across the street 

there are many cats in the streets 
eating the scraps from the market
watching them makes me understand why my cat is the way he is 

he would like it here 
we would have brought him 
if not for the long plane ride 

I am thinking of him often 
and hope that he is doing okay
at home BOWL OF SOUP

It’s okay to sit back
and watch some reality TV

I have gotten used to it 
somewhat 

there are a lot of very wealthy people
and they are very busy all the time 

for me 
I am happiest 

when I am able to write 
I don’t know why exactly 

today we were at the western wall 
watching them light the hanukah candles

there were a lot of tv cameras there 
filming the rabbis 

there were a lot of security guards 
and people from the military 

it would make a good episode 
of anyone’s reality show 

afterward we were exhausted
from walking as far as we did  
 
we shared a bowl of vegetable soup 
and it was as good of a bowl of soup that I’ve ever had 

nothing could beat it 
not the wealth on tv, the holiest menorah on the planet or the writing 

the soup 
was awesome 
THE WORST PIECE OF SHIT POEM

we went to the holocaust museum 
and I saw that in the concentration camps 
people still found a way to write 

in my life 
it seems that my worst self 
is the one that is unable to find meaning and fulfilment 

but writing 
has always helped me 
sort it out 

even the worst poem 
even the worst piece of shit poem
finds a way to be meaningful and fulfilling

to be self conscious about it
–– is so idiotic 
but confidence is not cheap 

I saw that someone had made a tiny chessboard 
out of tiny pieces of paper 
and I could see how important a game can be 

these people who had been separated from their families 
and had everything stripped away from them 
I saw that they still found a way to write and to play chess

I don’t know what the meaning of it is exactly 
but it made me feel connected to those 
people 
THIS DAMN ROOSTER

I am drinking maxwell house coffee
and listening to a rooster 

I would say that the coffee isn’t too bad
but this damn rooster can go to hell 
MEMORABLE PIZZA SLICE

from king george street 

green olive 
& cheese 

I love my wife HONEYMOON & ONE YEAR WEDDING ANNIVERSARY

for our one year wedding anniversary 
we ate a giant cauliflower 
and a smashed potato 
and something else... 
I forget what right now 

the people at the restaurant lit the hanukah candles 
and passed around an egg filled bread thing with sour cream 

it was a kebab 
that's what 
with more roasted veggies 
in a pita 
and we ate it outside under a heat lamp 

we walked back to the room afterward
and we watched tv

I keep mixing up the day of our anniversary 
I think it was today 
but maybe it's tomorrow 
actually 
it was yesterday

I don't know what we did today then
or yesterday

it has been as good of a honeymoon
as anyone has ever been on 
we have stepped outside of time 
and it is just us 
being together WAITING ON THE TARMAC

I was picking my nose a lot on the plane 
there was no end to it

it was a twelve hour flight
plus an hour delay taking off 

once we landed 
we spent another hour sitting on the tarmac waiting to find a gate 

I was picking my nose 
the entire time 

through customs 
on the drive home

and now sitting here
it goes on SMALL FLIES PORRIDGE

small flies 
consider porridge 

fridge magnets 
look great 

my wife made a joke
to her mom and brother 

about incest 
it was something from the kardashians 

her brother got mad 
and the truth 

is I'm not innocent either 
because when my wife and I 

were watching the kardashians 
I was the one who originally made the incest joke 

it is a terrible thing 
to joke about incest 

especially when it comes to your mother in law 
and brother in law 

but if it wasn't a terrible thing 
there would be no reason to laugh 

so I don't know if it can stop 
unlike those 

small flies 
unlike the porridge 

unlike the great 
fridge magnets A GREAT COMPLICATION

to say something idiotic 
and insightful at once 

is complicated 
and therefor good 

I have little to say otherwise truly 
I am merely exhausted 

the stupidest thing I could say right now 
seems out of reach 

and now that that is so 
I can see how great it is 

to think of the stupidest thing 
you have ever heard 

and to write it down 
and pretend that it is deeply insightful 

they say that you can’t polish a turd
but you can 

you just need the right polish 
you need turd polish 

it’s a speciality item 
and not many stores carry it 

and in case you’re wondering 
it’s sold out online 

it’s also really expensive 
and there’s hardly any in the tin 

I suppose the fear 
that I have 

is that I am a turd and they are right 
about the polish 

fictional turd polish 
vs the inevitable turd 

two opposing ideas 
a great complication MEMORY BOX

a microchip 
of twig proportions 

squeegee 
orange 

I would say 
that there is a microchip

on the doorstep 
and it is very good 

everyone will want that microchip 
they will want to have it 

they will want to keep it in their memory box 
to always remember 

the time they found it 
sitting on their doorstep for no reason 

I guess I don't really have a memory box myself 
just this green tin where I keep my wallet and keys at the end of the day 

I threw a lot of my stuff in the garbage 
but if I had a memory box 

I would put my swiss army knife in it 
my dad gave me it when I was a kid 
A GOOD YEAR

this will be the last post of the year 2022
let us take a moment to reflect on how things went...

it was a good year 
for many reasons 

here is 2021's final post –– 
ALLEYWAY SQUID 

there was a squid stuffed in the trash can 
its tentacles hung around the edge 

it was there overnight
and in the morning the alleyway stunk irreconcilably

a woman came out of the bakery 
holding a barbecue lighter

she stuffed it into the squids head 
and tried to light it

but her plan failed 
and she broke her barbecue lighter 

a woman came from the deli
and tried to bag the squid 

but it was too slippery 
and she ended up tearing the bag 

the women stood there 
frustrated as hell

they wanted the squid out of there
they made a new plan 

they came back with 
supplies 

one of them dragged her axe 
while the other knotted a rope 

they tied the rope to the trash can
and angled it around a pulley system 

that wrapped around a street lamp 
and a dumpster 

they counted down 
and on three 

the woman swung the axe
and severed the rope

the squid flew through the air 
almost two city blocks 

as far as they were concerned 
it was long gone 

the squid was someone else's problem 
now 

that was a good post 
so I suppose it's fair to say that was two good years in a row 

my resolutions... 
1. go to the library often 

2. go to Mama's Pizza soon 
3. make money to give to the baby 

love,
josh

CONSIDERING SOUP

today 
I made asparagus soup

first I cooked the asparagus 
in the pot with some oil 

and then 
I added in some onions and garlic 

and some water 
and salt and pepper 

we had a chicken bone broth pack thing 
that I added too 

and at the last minute
I put in a little bit of dill 

everyone had a bowl 
and they liked it 

there is even a bit left
that we will eat for lunch tomorrow 

I think that people should make soup 
more often 

I think that if more people made more soup 
the world would be a better place 

you can try to think of an argument 
against what I'm saying

but I doubt you will find a decent 
rebuttal 

I know that I say a lot of things that don't always make sense 
or that are idiotic 

but this 
this is the real thing 

this thing about soup 
is as true 

as anything 
ever 

if you think I'm wrong then you don't know jack shit 
and you can eat your own ass 

so man
good luck with that CONSIDERING HOME

I called my mom today 
and we spoke on the phone 
for a little bit 

I hope that she is doing ok

I moved away from home 
a long time ago 
I think all the way back in 2010 

twelve years 

when I was a kid, maybe four years old...  
she told me a bed time story 
about a kid who ran away from home 

he packed some peanut butter sandwiches
and some snacks in his backpack 
and he ran away from home 

he got lost and met all these dinosaurs 
who were kind to him 
eventually they helped him out and he went back home 

and everything was alright in the end 

it's one of my earliest memories 
I doubt she remembers it 
but I always remembered that story 

it is difficult to be away from the people that you love
DIM SUM

it was nice to take the subway 
in the afternoon 

it's faster than driving 
and we don't have to fuss with parking 

we had a checkup appointment 
at the doctor 

I was making chess moves on my phone 
while she was talking 

and I realized I probably shouldn't do 
that

the nurse used some kind of radio machine 
and we heard the baby 

swimming around 
the water 

afterward 
we went for dim sum 

and ordered a lot of food 
I was feeling like we spent too much money on it all 

but then there were enough leftovers
that we had ate it for dinner also 

most of all 
I am looking forward to meeting our daughter 

when the time comes 
I will try to teach her what I know 
FLIP MITTS

I was online shopping 
for a pair of gloves that I can use my phone with 

they have special fingers 
so you can text 

I read some of the reviews 
and a lot of people are saying ––

god damn these fucking gloves don't work for shit ––  
they're warm –– but you can't type jack shit with these fucking things! 

I was scratching my head 
and looking through all of the options 

a lot of them are really expensive 
some are over a hundred bucks

I saw one pair that were highly recommended by many 
but they cost forty bucks

and then I had the realization 
that I could get those old style mitts that flip so your fingers come out

then you don't have to worry about anything 
and they are probably cheap 

problem solved
get the flip mitts 

but first
I'll check and see what they have at Costco 

it's always good to do that 
that's how I was raised at least 

and then, that way 
maybe I'll get a hot dog or something after MOTIVATIONAL SPEECH

it is good to write the most fucked up story you can 
it is good to write whatever the hell you want 

it is good to write the most bizarre possible thing 
it is good to write something that people won't give two shits about 

it is good to put effort into not giving a fuck 
it is good to put effort into writing something people will think is too melodramatic 

it is good to put effort into writing something people will think is too mundane 
it is good to put effort into letting the story be what it is 

and finishing it 
and writing the next one 

I know sometimes it's a shit process 
and a lot of guys killed themselves over it 

reconcile your intuition and figure it out 
for your own sake

or die trying 
I suppose 
BROKEN DELETE KEY

I was standing in the hallway today 
and I thought of something 

girls sit down to pee
every time they go to the bathroom 

which means they always have the option 
to take a crap 

boys 
on the other hand 

don't always get to take a dump
every time they take a wiz 

it's smart 
the way they do it that way 

for the most part
they're probably way less constipated 

but there's no way I'm going to try to take a dump
every time I go to take a piss 

I'm looking at the hallway again now 
and I don't know why that occurred to me when it did 

I must admit 
that I wish I wrote something else here today

but my delete key seems to be broken 
it seems there's nothing I can do about it now HAVE YOUR SNOT MELT ON THE EARTH

how many fucks 
can be given 

how many fucks 
can become value menu burgers 

how many fucks
have been diagnosed with treatment resistant depression 

a lot of fucks 
can be given 

be generous 
be charitable 

have snot 
ready 

in your nose 
in case you need to snot rocket upward at the sun 

and have your snot melt 
on the earth 

give every fuck 
and melt your snot 

all over the earth 
and eat a value burger with melted snot 

and go to the psychiatrist with melted snot
and the psychologist and anyone else 

truthfully 
it is a mitzvah 

to give every fuck 
and melt snot VALUE BURGERS AND MELTED SNOT FOREVER

I had a dream last night 
about some people that used to be my friends 
but we grew apart 

I am looking now 
at some gunk on the ground
and a hairball on my sock 

I went to two pet stores today 
and the dollar store 
and my buddy's house 

tomorrow 
I have to go out and lecture at the school 
I am looking forward to reading my book on the subway 

I am looking forward to being alone 
before I have to be with people
I am looking forward to coming back to my table here

I am looking forward to having some time to write 
I want to write about some emotional shit 
I want to write about the pet store 

and value burgers and melted snot 
and all the people who used to be my friends 
and some gunk on the ground and a hairball on my sock 

and then I want to write about value burgers 
and melted snot 
again 

I want to write about value burgers 
and melted snot
forever NO BULLSHIT, NO SCHEMING

it was good to come home today 
and to sit at my desk 

and write 
a page 

in my own 
time 

it was good to eat soup 
for dinner 

it was good to stand in the yard 
with my cat 

there is no fuckin escrow account 
there is no fuckin dumb shit 

there is only me 
at my desk 

doing what the fuck 
needs to be done 

writing the words 
in my own time 

melted snot 
value burgers 

no bullshit 
no scheming 

no sound effects 
no actors 

fake pixel ink 
delete key 

I am a pip squeak 
I am a worm ass bitch 

so fuck off 
with any dumb shitSTEP INTO THE MUD

I spent too long in the snot castle 
and now my brain is empty 

tomorrow 
I have to read a book

I have to sit in my chair 
and focus on value burgers 

if you do not read 
you will die 

you will wither 
into a worm ass bitch

you will wither
into

a 
worm 

ass 
bitch 

do you have faith in value burgers?
are you worshipping the snot castle?

is there some kind of depression floating in front of your face 
or are you a worm ass bitch 

tomorrow I would like to put on a pair of rubber boots 
and step into the mud 

I don't own rubber boots 
but I have my hiking shoes 

I will wear them 
and go to the park 

and step 
into the mud TWIG BURGER

there was a large twig 
in the value burger that I ordered 

when they gave me the paper bag 
the twig stuck out either side –– almost like a helicopter 

I opened up the packaging 
two pieces of bread, melted snot and a damn massive twig? 

I sat on the planter outside 
staring at it 

all I ordered was a single value burger with melted snot 
and they gave me a freakin twig burger? 

I took a bite 
thinking... maybe it was a giant french fry 

but I was wrong 
I knew I was wrong, but I didn't want to be right 

I didn't want the twig 
to be a twig 

I went back in 
and showed it to the employee 

we didn't put a fucking twig in your burger man 
they said 

and even if we did 
why the fuck would you take a bite out of it? 

I didn't have an answer 
instead I asked for some extra mustard 

they gave it to me 
and I ate my twig burger, value, melted snot & all 

sitting on the planter 
in the car exhaust 
THE INTRINSIC VALUE BURGER

I am wondering the value
of ––

the value 
burger

I am not questioning its value 
I am simply wondering, the value 

there is no value 
to snot, itself 

it simply is 
what it is 

the intrinsic value of the value burger 
is beyond my ability to calculate 

but rest assured 
when you sit down 

at the restaurant 
and open the packaging 

of the value burger 
you will not question its value 

intrinsic 
or not 

you will know
you did the right thingTWO KINDS OF FICTIONAL REGRET

the origami sewer 
is not what it sounds like 

there are no folded up pieces of paper 
there is no sewage 

the origami sewer is something else entirely 
I actually have no idea what it is 

for a moment I liked the sound of it 
but now I think it's stupid

I once lied and said my delete key was broken 
but I couldn't do that again 

the truth is 
I feel like talking about the regret 

it feels good 
to talk about fictional regret 

like watching fictional people shoot each other 
in an action movie

the origami sewer 
what a dumb idea

in a way 
it is kind of funny, I suppose 

instead I want to write about something else
I want to write about discounted cabbage roles at the hot bar

they were on for fifty percent off
I'm sure they are all sold out by now 

the truth 
is that I'm still talking about fictional regret 

because I walked right past them 
and I didn't buy them 

it happened this morning 
when we were at the supermarket MY TRIANGLE FRIEND

my friend is shaped as a triangle 
he looks like a cartoon some kid drew 

he is shaped as an actual triangle 
his arms stick out from his sides and his legs come out from the bottom line 

his eyes are slightly above his arms 
his mouth is slightly below his eyes and go across his entire body 

he was once offered a lot of money to be the Doritos mascot
but he was more interested in a less public job 

we talk on the phone often 
at least once a week, sometimes more 

he doesn't always have much to say 
and neither do I 

sometimes we just sit there on the line 
quietly 

he is obsessed with petroleum jelly and
he is a respected chiropractor 

he is hoping to find a girlfriend 
so if you know anyone that might be interested 

let me know 
and we'll see if it works outFREE VACATION

I have imagined a hotel 
called 
the dolphin spring hotel 

it is on the side of the highway 
it is not very expensive 
fifty nine dollars a night 

there are two vending machines 
side by side 
one is for drinks and the other is for candy and chips

if I stayed at that hotel 
I would just watch tv all day 
and order a pizza and get some sodas and eat chips 

instead 
I will just imagine it 
maybe that is enough 

to just imagine a thing 
and to be there 
that way 

you should get good at imagining things 
it is a cheap way
to travel

MY WIFE

I was talking to my wife
while I was buying something at the store

and she was telling me about her friend's 
diarrhea 

my wife tells me all kinds of things
she always has something to talk about

it is hard for me to feel like a piece of shit 
with her around 

it is hard for me to feel like a piece of shit 
even when I have diarrhea, with her around 

I never met anyone 
that sees the good in the world 

as effortlessly and authentically 
as she does 
CAPITALIST JOY

this weekend 
I am going to the book store 

I probably won't buy anything 
I just want to look at the books 

I already have a cat training book from the library that I need to
finish 

I am trying to learn some things to help our cat 
lately we have been taking him on a lot of walks and playing with his bird toy and springs a lot 

this weekend 
I might go to home depot 

I want to buy a new door for my office
I think it will help quiet things down 

and it would be nice 
to have a brand new door 

I saw one online 
that is made of pine 

it is three hundred dollars 
I don't know if I will buy it 

yet 
eventually I will I CAN'T BELIEVE IT TOOK ME 35 YEARS TO BEAT THIS FUCKING GAME ON EASY MODE

I have nothing left 
to say 

truly 
I think I have gotten to the end 

I have beat the game 
I am going to take this cartridge to the used nintendo store 

and get some credit
for another game 

or maybe 
I'll just take the cash 

it's always a shitty deal 
if you take the cash

you should always take
the store credit 

and even then
it's a shitty deal 

honestly
I don't think I'll trade it in 

because 
I was playing on easy mode

I can't believe it took me 35 years to beat this fucking game 
on easy mode

I suppose that settles it 
I will start again, now –– for the first time, perhaps 

this time 
I will set it to normal THE TRUTH INTO WORDS

"Dreams are disconnected, 
they accept the most violent contradictions without the least objection, 
they admit impossibilities, 
they disregard knowledge which carries great weight with us in the day-time, 
they reveal us as ethical and moral imbeciles. 

Anyone who when he was awake behaved in the sort of way that is shown in situations in dreams would be considered insane. 

Anyone who when he was awake talked in the sort of way that people talk in dreams or described the sort of thing that happens in dreams would gives the impression of being muddle-headed or feeble-minded.

It seems to be no more than putting the truth into words 
when we express our very low opinion of mental activity 
in dreams 
and assert that in dreams the higher intellectual faculties in particular are suspended 
or at all events gravely impaired."

Sigmund Freud 
1899
ONE OF THE BEST TIMES OF ALL TIME

I am happy to sit here 
at my computer 

wearing sweatpants 
and drinking a cup of water

and now 
I am going to think of something to write  

my wife is five months pregnant 
and she is making a cup of tea

our cat 
is running up and down the hall 

in a few months 
it will all change 

and in all likelihood 
I will remember how things are now

as one of the best times 
of all time COSTCO HOTDOG

my mother in law
brought me a hot dog 
from costco 
today 

it is the best item
it is the best snack
it is the best meal
it is the best thing

it comes with a free drink 
it is one dollar and fifty cents 
it is the reward for any suffering you have endured in your entire life 
it is the only time anyone is convinced that money is worth making 

please listen to what I'm about to tell you 
when you are at costco 
buy yourself a hotdog 
or buy one for a friend or anyone 

do not live a shitty life 
learn the value of a dollar
you will become better
you will return to who you are 

you will return 
to who
you have always 
been THE CAN OF TUNA IN THE SNOW

the blender 
is somewhere 

the mud
is beneath a cloud 

it was snowing 
and now it is not snowing 

at the moment there is no reason to wonder
about anything 

at the moment 
there is celery growing somewhere 

at the moment 
there is a computer chip inside of a piece of celery 

and someone will eat it 
accidentally 

they will know what it is like 
to eat a computer chip 

and it will be the day 
that they ate a microchip 

they will talk about it 
forever

they will talk about how they ate a microchip 
that one day 

they will stare at the wall
and they will not think of the insulation in it

they will think of the empty can 
of tuna 

that they saw 
in the snow 

even after they are dead
they will still remember it

it will be printed 
off an inkjet printer 

and they will never
forget

the can of tuna
in the snowTHE COLESLAW PETITION

the petition 
was written 

it was between a guy 
and himself 

the petition said 
that he was a motherfucker 

he felt that word described him 
better than any other 

when he thought of himself 
he liked thinking that he was a motherfucker 

I am no longer thinking about that guy 
I am now thinking about coleslaw 

in a plastic cup 
from the deli 

I would like to have a couple bites of that 
just the cheap kind from any deli 

I would eat it in the grocery store parking lot 
in the snow 

people would say 
that I was a motherfucker 

but I would give them the middle finger 
and I would tell them that I didn't sign any petition 

and I would toss the rest of the coleslaw at their windshield
or door 

and then there would be coleslaw 
frozen in the snow THE GREAT IDIOCY

it takes a lot of work 
to thoroughly not give a shit 

it is difficult 
not to give a fuck 

I give a lot of shits
and fucks

not from lack 
of trying 

I am 
still working on it

I am hoping to become 
as confident as possible 

without 
losing the great idiocy 

I would like to be confident enough
to be as naive 

as a complete dumb ass 
and not give a shit or a fuck

and to look at things 
as I do 

to look at things 
blissfully 

in a way that is so stupid 
that there is nothing 

left
aside 

from
what it is SNAIL FRIEND

a box of nails 
and a hammer 

a box of snails 
and a hammer 

snails 
nails 

I hope that no one would use a snail 
as a nail 

I saw a snail on the street
a few months ago 

it was just there
looking at the dirt 

I always liked snails 
I always thought they were funny 

I hope to know a snail one day 
I hope to have a snail as a friend 

to go for coffee with 
to ask advice of 

to split a large pizza with 
to shoot the shit 

a snail for a friend 
that sounds alright 

I hope I do not go the rest of my life
without a friend like that 

I hope I do not die
without having a snail as a friend THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE LATE FINES

I am imagining 
a bag of frozen 
spicy curly fries 

tomorrow 
I will walk through the snow 
while drinking coffee

I do not know what I will think about 
I will be by myself 
walking 

I am in a state 
of general happiness 
that is better than usual 

it is true 
that this is the best quality of life
I have ever lived

it is true 
that I have spent years 
as a miserable piece of shit 

it is true 
that I wasn't sure 
if it would subside 

or if that's what it was 
to walk around 
the snow, drinking coffee

still imaging 
frozen
curly fries 

it is possible 
to better yourself 
it is possible to figure things out 

in a way 
I hate to admit it 
but it's true 

one thing that helped then
was going to the library 
I don't know why, exactly –– but it did

back when they still had late fines
–– they got rid of late fines in our city 
which is bullshit 

there should always 
be
late fines 

there should always 
be
frozen spicy curly fries 

floating in a thought bubble
above your 
headTHE GREAT IDIOCY II

I became upset today 
for a few reasons 

one –– 
I slipped on the ice and scared my cat when we were outside and he bit my hand 

two –– 
the lecture I gave today fucking bombed, god damn it

three –– 
I returned my library book a day late 

and they don't even charge late fines anymore 
so I can't even reconcile it 

I feel like a failure 
and I feel tired 

but 
(and I'm not trying to be optimistic by saying this)

the truth is ––
I am enjoying looking like an idiot 

because I cannot deny 
that I am not fucking bullshitting myself 

so 
fuck off world 

and I know I have used the title already 
but I will use it again 

because I am feeling what it is 
–– the great idiocy EATING SHIT

you cannot be yourself 
without a lot of people thinking you are fucked

you cannot be yourself 
without a lot of people thinking you suck ass

you cannot be yourself without 
eating shit 

somehow I have become excited to eat shit 
tomorrow 

and 
on Friday 

imagine all the shit you can eat 
imagine the buffet of shit that is waiting for you 

as you learn 
to be who you are 

as you learn 
to be an honest person 

as you learn 
to have integrity 

you cannot be yourself 
without eating shit 

that is how 
it works LUCK AND HEARSAY

when I went downstairs 
to get a snack 

I saw my wife 
holding her cellphone speaker to her stomach, playing les mis for the baby 

now I am eating an orange
and potato chips

our cat 
is licking his paw 

I don't really feel like making anything up or saying anything important... 
but I will say this –– 

earlier today I was walking in the snow 
and I felt as good as I've ever felt in my life 

I've spent years of my life feeling miserable
for no good reason 

and my only advice to anyone is this –– 
don't bullshit yourself 

to the best of your ability, make choices that align with who you are 
and that will allow a chance for things to turn up 

as far as I'm concerned 
everything else is luck and hearsay IDEA FOR A NOVELTY CHESS T-SHIRT

I thought of a new catch phrase today
"it's never too late to castle" 

I would get it written on a t-shirt 
and there would be a king and a rook on it 

there would be two versions of the shirt 
one would be black and have white pieces

and the other 
would be white and have black pieces on it 

otherwise 
I don't have much to say 

except 
writing stories 

is difficult 
they are next to impossible to get right 

but 
it is worth trying 

I don't know how to tie that thought 
back to the one about the chess t-shirt 

which I suppose
proves my point 

that writing stories 
is next to impossible 

to get 
right
SUBWAY COUPONS

I ate a massive sandwich 
for supper

I have no feelings 
they are constipated in the sandwich 

I have forgotten who I am 
from eating that sandwich 

the coupon came in the mail 
it expires this week

so we went for it
we used the coupon 

I am so full 
I have no feelings 

I should have only had half 
of that sandwich 

I will sleep soundly 
this evening 

unless I have night tremmors 
from the digestion 

I will make sure the switch 
to my nightlight is handy 

in case I wake up 
screaming 

I don't know if I regret it altogether 
but I will be weary in the future 

of those coupons 
that come in the mail A GREAT CARTOON

I am working on 
a great cartoon 

so far it is eight minutes 
and forty five seconds 

I have done five of the 
nine scenes 

in the end 
it will probably be... 

hold on 
I need a calculator 

I think it will be about 
fifteen minutes 

that is a lot 
but I worked on the story for a long time 

I am worried
that it will be too crass for some

as I type that 
I realize 

that is a pussy ass thought 
that is a great way to become the world's biggest bitch

I am glad I chose to write about the cartoon 
to catch that thought 

I don't want to worry 
about dumb shit like that anymore 

I don't want to worry 
about people and whatever fuckin shit 

I want to make my work 
for myself 

I don't want to worry 
about any bullshit ever again 

I hope that if you are making anything 
you also are done giving a fuck 

enjoy what you are doing –– as much as you can 
that is the skill 
THE COMPUTER

I suppose 
there is little to nothing to say 

it is peaceful 
here

I am complacently looking 
at this glasses cloth thing 

the thing you use 
to clean your glasses

when I was a kid and they told me I needed glasses 
I was scared shitless 

but now 
I like wearing my glasses 

I was probably ten or something 
now I am thirty five

there is a picture of me from around that time
and I'm sitting on the computer 

it is possible I've spent most of my life 
on the computer 

I have no problem with that 
I have always enjoyed being here 

I suppose it is strange
how little I feel like I have to say 

but for me it is enough 
to remember some good days from back when I was a kid
WHEN IT IS TIME

I don't know if you have ever had a pregnant wife before
but

it is something 
to put your hand on her belly

and to feel that there is a baby there 
I don't really have the words to describe it

it is some combination 
of fear and awe 

the pants that used to be too big on her 
now fit her well

I am excited to meet our daughter when it is time
in a way I feel like I know her already 

I wanted to mention 
one other thing as well 

the name we chose for her 
has the same first letter as my wife's great grandmother 

she used to give onion and schmaltz sandwiches to homeless people
during the great depression

today I ate a sandwich like that for lunch 
and I thought it was good
PLOT AND PLOTLESSNESS

there is a difference 
between writing plot 

and writing 
to say what you need to say 

I was working on plot all day today 
and now I feel like shit 

I feel like I didn't get anywhere
writing plot gives me fucking indigestion 

it is fucking hard to write a story 
I don't know 

sometimes I think that the best thing to do 
is ignore it completely 

both plot 
and plotlessness are misery 

I feel better already
having written those two lines 

than the eight or nine or however many hours 
I put into breaking down my story today 

sometimes people ask me what I'm writing 
and I get embarrassed and fumble my words pretty badly 

even after working on something for hundreds of hours
I can't articulate it 

I am happiest
writing about things that I can't explain –– ordinarily 

trying to sort out the unknown 
and if I knew what the fuck I was saying 

I wouldn't feel the need to say it 
that is the whole point 

so what I'm saying now 
is fuck it all DO NOT GIVE PEACE A CHANCE

I didn't have the most productive week 
not from a lack of trying 

I lost sight of myself somehow 
I fuckin hate when that happens 

without that though –– 
there would be nothing to do 

it would be too stagnant 
if you knew who you were, at all times 

if you could never push yourself into doubt 
and confusion 

there would be no fucked up nonsensical poems 
there would be no searching 

I would say this 
despite popular opinion 

–– do not give peace a chance 
do not trust it for a second 

it is a deceptive feeling 
it will bite you in the ass

and trust me 
you don't want to get bit in the ass 

my suggestion then 
is to forget everything you know 

become the stupidest person 
possible 

become a complete idiot 
beyond all comprehension 

if you do not become a complete dumbass
you will get bit in the ass by god knows what 

and you will be eternally miserable 
and you will never write well 

that is what I know 
thank you for your time 

and by the way
I got a good haircut today 

it's looking pretty spiky 
especially for a bald guy 
QUITTING FICTION

I haven't been too interested 
in writing made up stories lately 

but really –– the impulse will return 
it always does

we bought a baby stroller  
off some woman online today

it cost us 80 dollars 
new it costs 500

the woman we bought it off 
seemed very kind and used it for three kids already 

we brought it home and messed around with it in the garage 
it seems like it will be good for us 

we are trying to decide how we will spell the baby's name 
... if there should be an h at the end or not 

I don't think the h is necessary 
but my wife likes it 

I told her that if our daughter wants the h 
I will take her and we can get it legally changed

I am putting it in writing here
so there's no going back on it

when you write something down –– it's real 
that's how it works now that I've quit fiction 
AIMING FOR A MEANINGLESS OUTCOME

I keep deleting what I've written 
the momentum is off for some reason 

I have been lost in a fantasy 
about quitting fiction writing 

a fantasy 
is an attempt to augment our reality

it is a way of reconciling 
the anxiety of the moment 
 
the idea of quitting fiction writing 
is a fantasy and a fiction in itself 

the question I would ask
as usual –– is –– what is the fiction trying to reconcile 

whether it is a wish fulfillment 
or an attempt to organize the world into something understandable... 

there is no real need to quit 
but 

I am learning to allow myself to write here like I do in my journal 
regardless of if it is boring 

I don't know why I resisted it 
but it seems refreshing 

it is important to write the truth 
whether it is fiction or not 

the outcome of it all will define itself
for now, it's best for it to remain meaningless OUR DATE

for valentine's day 
we went to five guys burger restaurant 

we ate some peanuts while we waited 
for them to cook our burger and fries

there are unlimited refills there 
we had diet coke and iced tea

we had a good time there
and I would look forward to going back one day 

afterward we went to some other stores
we looked at some baby clothes

we bought a new shower curtain 
we bought quail eggs for our cat

it was a good way to spend the evening 
usually we don't go out on Tuesdays 

but we had a full tank of a gas 
and it was valentine's day 

so we thought we'd make the most 
of our date 
A SINCERE CONGRATS

today I finished working on my cartoon 
I think that it is the best thing that I've ever done

I have never given a sincere bow before 
until today 

of all the years 
of feeling like I couldn't get it right 

this one 
works

I was able to say 
what I wanted 

I was able to be
myself 

it is not that often I feel as proud as I do 
of this cartoon 

so I will take a moment to give myself 
a pat on the back & a sincere congrats... 

–– good work buddy 
you did it –– 

I have been trying to make a cartoon like this 
since I was a kid 

I will look forward to sharing it
online soon CHEESE BLINTZES

today we went to one of our favourite grocery stores 
we always go there and look at the sales 

they have cheese blintzes 
that go on sale 

6.99 for 6 of them 
instead of 12.99 for 6 of them 

I buy a pack every time they are on sale 
I love eating them 

ever since I was a kid 
cheese blintzes have been one of my favourite foods

even now as I am thinking of blintzes 
I am overwhelmed with happiness 

my mom used to make them for me on my birthday 
every year 

there is almost nothing as dear to me 
as that 

there are certain things that are imprinted onto your being 
that bring you back to who you are 

it is beyond sentiment 
for me –– it is cheese blintzes 

I will hope to be there for our daughter 
as she figures out 

what it is 
for herTHE IDIOT TREE

here is the new story 
that I've been working on –– 

it is about a man 
who lives alone in the woods 

he goes into town to get gas from costco 
and there is a big snowstorm 

he ends up driving a woman home
she works at the costco restaurant 

he ends up getting her pregnant 
and now... he needs to make money 

so he takes some mushrooms from a tree in the woods (that's the idiot tree from the title) 
and brings them to the farmer's market 

but he doesn't sell any of them 
so he steals a bag of money from a brinx truck 

he drives until he runs out of gas 
and then he is lost 

he meets an archaic cult 
and learns that the money he stole is useless to them 

their currency is based around ritual sacrifices 
to their higher power 

eventually he begins to understand and adopt their point of view 
and captures a very important animal 

he is set free from the cult 
and finally returns home 

his girlfriend, the woman from costco who he got pregnant 
suggests that it is probably best if he is a stay at home dad 

he agrees 
and realizes he probably should have been more patient with the mushrooms 

that is more or less 
the story 

the ritual sacrifice stuff I took from reading exodus late last year 
in those times... burning animals to a higher power was a very intense thing to do 

imagine having to hunt your own food 
and never really having enough 

and then destroying it
on purpose 

burning it to show your faith 
to a higher power 

it is better to shop at costco 
and get a hot dog from the restaurant there 

as fictional as it all is... 
it's not really that fictional 

at the end 
of the day 
DANDRUFF SHAMPOO

there was a type of dandruff shampoo 
that my wife wanted me to get 

but they didn't have it 
at the store we looked at 

there is always dandruff from my beard
that goes on my shirt 

it makes me feel 
like a loser or something 

it is like when you first start going bald 
it takes some work to get used to it 

or if you feel like your beard has grown too long 
and people will think less of you because of it 

or if your clothes are dirty 
or old or don't fit well 

or if you peed your pants 
or if you have a booger in your nose or something 

sometimes it is hard not to care 
how you look 

I think it is good to try 
to care as little as possible 

but I know 
sometimes it's hard not to THE DOORKNOB OF LIGHTNING

the doorknob 
of lightning

has become 
entirely useless 

it is a shame 
and many people are disappointed 

personally 
I could care less about it 

I don't even know what it is 
I'd rather sit around eating pistachios 

or stand on the curb
looking at a fried fish sandwich poster in the window of a fast food restaurant 

I suppose that is all there is to say 
I don't have any news about acorns or twine if that's what you were expecting 

one time when I was in the grocery store with my sister
she poked her finger into a thing of ground beef 

because she thought it looked like a brain 
I'll never forget that moment 

it was the pinnacle 
of it all 

it was the doorknob 
of lightning GOING TOWARDS THE MCDONALDS

I was walking towards the McDonalds today 
and caught myself thinking 

that I would fail 
as a writer etc... 

but I caught the thought
and adjusted it

it takes effort
to stay hopeful

about whatever it is 
you have decided to be hopeful about 

it is easier 
to think that you will be defeated 

figure out what perspective is required 
to keep you going ahead 

towards whatever the fuck 
you are aiming at 

do not believe in yourself 
blindly 

do not defeat yourself 
blindly 

go towards the McDonalds 
get the coffee

a medium cup is only one dollar
from now until some time in march 

get it now
while supplies last THE KNIVES IN THE BLOCK

and now 
it is time to write out some thoughts 

sometimes 
there is a hollowness, an empty honeycomb above me 

and other times 
there is a lot of untethered emotional –– honeycomb 

it is possible that one is better than the other
but I don't care

I like to sit and write out my thoughts 
even if I have none 

even if I am brain dead 
or am standing under a tree and snow has fallen on my head or something like that 

at the best of times 
sitting and writing causes distraction 

all of the knives in the block are facing outward
and you have decided that you want to walk into it 

and you are going to stand there 
and pretend that you are fine 

well I suppose that's an exaggeration 
it's not always like that 

sometimes it is okay 
and I am sitting here pleasantly 

like right now 
it is good 

I used to think that was not how to write 
good 

but now 
I don't care

writing good 
is dumb FIGMENT

I never bothered looking up the word –– figment 
until now

it is something that someone believes to be real 
but only exists in their imagination 

I think before I thought that it meant 
a small piece 

like a morsel 
or something like that 

often I sit here 
figmenting 

but sometimes I figment too much 
and I feel like getting a dose of reality 

so I go and stick my head into the snow 
or do some pushups 

I don't have much else I really feel like going on about 
but I will note

that I had a calm and focused day 
I did alright

it was an average day and at the end of my life 
I would probably look back and say that it was the best day of my life

but until then I will consider it ordinary 
and I will look forward to continuing my work tomorrow 

RAT POISON
there are mice in our cupboards 
and now that we know they are there

they will have to 
die 

we put some poison out for them 
I surrounded it in a fortress 

of canned 
beans 

they nibbled into our matzoh box
and ate off the label of a jar of peanut butter 

our cat is young enough 
that he's never seen a mouse 

wait until he figures them out 
all of the hours playing with springs and feather toys 

all of his training 
put to the test 

we all have to grow up 
someday 

I feel like making a grand statement 
something like ––

eventually we either eat the rat poison 
or kill the mouse 

but that's totally meaningless
and banal 

I suppose the scheme has gone 
awry A LIGHT SWITCH

the mix of dolphin square pizza pops 
and origami regular pizza 
was mesmerizing 

I know I said that I wouldn't write 
meaningless abstract shit anymore
but this is serious 

some guy farted into a light switch 
and then when his girlfriend turned on the light 
it smelled like complete ass

she was so pissed at him 
she went into the freezer 
and threw all of his pizza pops out into the road 

he was so depressed 
he went into the road 
and fell to his knees 

he cried 
and mourned the pizza pops 
she tried not caring but she couldn't help it 

she went out into the street 
and she tried to calm him down 
eventually she understood why he was so upset about those pizza pops

they were the ones that they got from dolphin square
on their first date 
he said he was saving them for a special occasion 

she looked at them and the guilt overwhelmed her 
she didn't know what the appropriate reaction was 
to someone farting in a light switch 

eventually she saw that there was another pizza in the road 
someone had run over it and it was folded into weird shapes 
it was a strange coincidence and she wanted to assign some meaning to it 

but she couldn't 
so 
she just stared at it 
IT SEEMED TRIVIAL WHEN I RE-READ IT

I wrote some things here before
but then I deleted them 
and now I will start again 

I was writing about the snow 
but it seemed trivial 
when I re-read it 

it felt like I was saying something important 
but I second guessed it 
and decided it wasn't true 

I went down some rabbit holes today 
watching the snow 
and worrying about what people think 

it is easy to lose sight of things 
when you sit too long in your chair 
doing nothing

but if I do not sit long enough 
in my chair 
I have no idea who I am 

I will always want to sit 
and write things 
down 

I would like to say 
that everything else can go fuck itself 
and for the most part it can 

but if you do not walk around 
and break it up a bit 
you will fuck yourself

it is good when it is snowing out
it is good to walk in the snow 
for no reason

it is good to sit in a chair 
and write things down 
for no reason I AM A GLOB OF TOOTHPASTE EXPERIENCING MODERATE JOY

the anteater 
became a glob of toothpaste 

the anteater 
melted in the sun 

his credit card went off 
into the gutter 

he was at the bookstore
looking at new journals 

and he felt like a little bitch 
for doing that 

he remembered typing shit into DOS
when he was a kid 

and now 
his credit card went towards the gutter

and now
he was a glob of toothpaste, melted in the sun 

I never identified with an anteater before
until this morning 

this morning I was thinking of some song lyrics 
I have been hearing in the background for my entire life 

"I don't care who you are
what you did 

where you're from
as long as you love me" 

it was bullshit when it came out
and it's bullshit now 

so fuck off
with that shit 

and now 
after a day of being melted 

I have returned 
and all I will say is this –– 

I am a glob of toothpaste 
experiencing moderate joyFOR NOW THAT IS AS MUCH AS I KNOW

lately 
I have wanted to write better poems 

but 
thinking about writing poems 

leads to writing 
worse poems 

all you can do 
is sit down and write 

I have not edited a poem I have written 
in years 

I just write them 
and then move on to the next one 

I edit a lot of other shit 
but not these 

that's what makes them 
what they are 

the whole point 
maybe –– 

is that I have to accept them 
even when they are pieces of shit 

and in turn 
I have to accept myself 

as 
well 

in a way
it is easier 

to delete
and rewrite

and start again 
in a way 

it is excruciating 
to delete 

and rewrite
and start again 

I will always debate
which path is the one worth taking 

to repeatedly bang my head against the wall
getting it right 

or squishing the spaghetti in my hand 
and looking deep into the tomato sauce 

but at the end of the day 
the answer is simple

you must repeatedly bang your head against the wall 
while squishing the spaghetti in your hand and looking deep into the tomato sauce

for now 
that is as much as I know LOUISA'S STORY

when I was a kid 
my mom used to tell me about her dad

he died the same year 
I was born 

she tried to explain that his spirit lived on through us 
and I understood what she meant 

I have seldom seen her be as sincere 
as that 

a few years ago 
I wrote a script about my mom and how I imagined her childhood to be 

the script is focused around 
the sentiment I remembered her explaining, all those years ago 

for some reason or another 
I thought of animating that script today

and I realized that 
soon I will have a daughter and be her dad 

and one day, one way or another
she will lose me

it never occurred to me that I would be in the same position 
that my grandfather was 

and that she will be in the position 
that my mother was 

I would like to pass down the sentiment that my mother passed 
onto me 

I have decided that I will try to make that animation 
to give to her one day 

so that regardless of what happens 
she will have that OR SOMETHING

farting on an iguana's head
with a flashlight 

in the distance 
the flashlight looks like a streetlight 

but it is just the distance 
or something 

I am trying to draw a picture 
of a gas station 

but it is difficult 
to get it right 

I don't know why I wrote 
about farting on an iguana's head

but 
I think I will stick with it 

what would be the point of deleting it 
now

I cannot be ashamed
of writing 

about farting
on an iguana's head 

if I am ashamed of that
then 

writing about the shame of it 
instead

will be more
intellectual 

or 
something 

like the flashlight 
and the streetlight 

they are the same in the distance 
or something I WILL GO ON SALE BEFORE I EXPIRE

I don't think that I will die anytime soon
but it is possible 

if I died 
I am most concerned about my wife and daughter and cat 

I know that they would be okay 
but –– 

I suppose what I want
most of all 

is to get to be with them 
in the future 

I'm not looking for a big adventure
or anything like that 

just to get to stick around
for as long as I can 

eventually 
it will end 

eventually I will die 
and I won't know what happens afterward 

in the meantime 
I will keep writing things down 

and trying to be good for my family 
and I will look forward 

to whatever pizza 
and hamburgers are left 

and I will look forward to the cheese blintzes 
that go on sale 

when they are going to expire 
soon

I will promise one thing 
to you

I will go on sale 
before I expire 

and it will be the best sale 
you've ever seen 

in your 
life THE POINT

some days I don't get much writing done
not from a lack of effort 

it is something else, there is no reason 
it is just the way it goes 

I suppose I feel like going a bit easy on myself in the moment here
because I wasn't doing that throughout the day 

writing for the most part 
is a way of ironing out the confusion 

figuring out how you see things
one way or another 

if you think you've figured it out
you'll usually prove yourself wrong

and if you don't prove yourself wrong
you're probably missing the point 

I read some part of a book that was explaining what stakes are 
–– what happens if you get the thing, and what happens if you lose it 

the point it was making is that it's always both 
it can't just be one 

I suppose that stumped me throughout the day 
but it seems clear now 

get your family and find love 
or lose your family and find misery

well it seems I figured it out
so tomorrow, I'll try again 

and figure out 
what the point really is TABLE SAW

I have felt exhausted 
and frustrated 

steel wool 
brain 

but 
I caught a certain idea today 

something so idiotic 
that came from seemingly nowhere 

a guy running down the street 
with a massive erection and it getting sliced in half by a bandsaw 

it was a quick moment 
it was visceral and hilarious 

what a dumb ass thing to imagine 
what an amazing thing to imagine 

I spent the evening trying to make it into an animation 
on the computer

I will post it to YouTube 
when it is ready 

I changed it a bit 
he is on an escalator and there is a floating table saw instead of a bandsaw 

I suppose I feel less exhausted
and frustrated

having made
that cartoon 
TWO HUNDRED BUCKS

I am looking forward to 
tomorrow 

I am looking forward to drinking coffee
and frying up my eggs 

I will see what kind of ideas 
I can come up with 

I will go on a walk 
and I will read a book 

I will sit with my cat 
and 

I will look at my wife
and see that she is pregnant 

I know that the day will pass by quickly 
and then I will go to bed again 

one time a guy told me that he would throw me out of a car 
to make sure I wrote good poems 

I hope to never see that guy again 
and if he tries to throw me out of a car 

I will tell him that it is okay 
to write bad poems 

do not panic 
it is okay to write shit 

and by the way 
I bumped into a guy today 

that thinks I owe him two hundred bucks
he's still pissed 

but I don't owe him 
shit 

I said hi to him 
and he said hey 

the conversation ended there
he can bring it up if he wants 

but I already told him 
everything he needs to know 

I don't owe him
shit WILL SUFFICE

when I was cleaning out the snack cupboard today
I was feeling sad about death 

often I forget
as I’m sure most people do, that it is there 

I don’t know if I am as scared of it 
then I am sad about it 

I have been enjoying my time a lot
and I do not want to lose it 

I would like to keep getting the chance to go out to restaurants, 
to write, to watch youtube videos and spend time with my family 

this weekend we are debating going for falafels 
or pizza 

I would like to get both 
but my wife says one is enough and she is right 

I even ate three slices of pizza for dinner tonight when she was out 
but I still have an intense craving to order another one 

when I am going to die one day 
it will be sad to eat pizza for the last time 

in the meantime 
the only line of defence 

is to do as many things as I love doing 
as possible 

whatever you can get away with 
will suffice SMALL GARBAGE CAN

I am zoning out 
into a mood of strange joy 

I am pleased with the way 
today went 

I bought a small garbage can 
with a lid 

I will be happy to use it 
in the future 

I'm not sure what colour it is
tan or grey 

I would have to go downstairs 
and look 

it cost three dollars 
and I think it has a handle 

I forget 
I would have to go downstairs and look 

that little garbage can will be very helpful 
we will put all kinds of stuff in there 

I feel eternally grateful 
to that garbage can 

I am grateful that it will be itself 
first and foremost 

I am grateful that it will 
not bullshit anyone, including itself 

I am grateful that it will have the courage
to know the difference 

I am grateful that that little garbage can 
will be strong and stand up for what it believes in 

that garbage can 
is my hero 

I feel myself inspired 
to be like it 

it will be a symbol of stoicism and fortitude 
in our house HYPOTHETICAL VACATION

my wife told me
that it's time 

to trim down 
my beard

ok
I will do it 

tom-
-morrow 

before 
we go to costco 

I am trying to quiet my thoughts 
but they are moving quickly 

it makes it difficult to write
meaningfully 

I have a tooth ache 
we lost an hour to daylight savings 

we ate macaroni and cheese
for dinner 

I wouldn't mind 
being outside 

right 
now 

it is late
and snowing 

perhaps a walk through the woods 
is in order, tomorrow 

or perhaps 
we should fly somewhere where it is warm 

and sit near water
and film a home video 

about 
our vacation 

I will try to think of this hypothetical vacation
tomorrow 

when we are at 
costco 

when I am standing near the beef & chicken 
looking out in to the great beyond 

I WILL NOT BITE HIS TOE
in the middle of the night 
my cat bit my toe 

I woke up 
and yelled at him

I feel bad for getting so angry at him 
but you can't go and bite someone's toe when they're sleeping! 

somehow it makes me love him even more
when he does insane things like that 

even though 
I have been exhausted all day 

and fighting off 
the looming evil cloud 

on a day like this 
I can see the side of myself 

that gets 
chronically upset 

exercise helps 
art doesn't really 

art is what you do 
regardless 

exercise 
is medicine

art is
a symptom

it is as much the problem as it is the solution 
it cancels itself out 

I don't know if I believe that entirely 
it's usually foolish to make such a bold claim 

my cat is sleeping now 
in his tree, behind me 

I will not bite his toe 
–– instead 

I will wind down 
and go to bed also 
A LIFE OF DUST AND CRUMBS

I had a sudden realization 
that I could use the dust buster on my keyboard

and get 
all the crumbs out 

I went for it 
and now there are less crumbs 

the title of this poem 
will be 

a life of
dust and crumbs 

usually I don't pick the title until the end
but today is different 

earlier my wife helped me shave my neckline 
she went lower down than I usually would 

but it seems 
I look a bit more normal 

it is hard to know where to trim the bottom of your beard
so that it doesn't look weird 

I also have a lot of nose hairs 
and ear hairs 

I am learning 
there are different way of dealing with them 

there is something to be said for all of these machines
dust busters and electric shavers and stuff like that 

I don't know exactly what there is to be said for them 
but surely, 

it seems
that there is something to be said THE DOG WITH HIS TAIL TIED IN A KNOT

I was walking back from the subway 
and I saw 

this dog 
with his tail tied in a knot 

a woman was trying to help him 
but she couldn’t fix it 

some other guy was also trying to help 
he tugged at the knot with all his might

but he couldn't get it loose 
and he said that the worst had come

the man said that there was no choice left
he was going to cut the dog's tail off

the man could not stand 
the knot 

it was driving him off the wall
he was losing his mind over the dog's knotted tail 

he went to get the sheers from his garage 
and then 

the man realized 
that the dog's tail was not in a knot 

he realized that the woman was not there
and he realized 

that I was not there either 
he realized that he was staring at a normal dog 

and then 
the man screamed until his head exploded

and that 
is when I saw the dog 

with the knotted tail 
running up the street 

when I was walking back
from the subway I MAY BE UNSPOOLED YARN

I often feel close
to failure 

perhaps 
my days spent at my desk 

are nothing 
but an attempt at defence 

against 
that 

rather than 
an aim to succeed 

avoiding failure 
rather than 

aiming 
to succeed 

I find it hard to imagine 
that feeling successful 

is at the core 
of anyone's being 

this may be a gross miscalculation on my end 
or it may not be 

I may not be practicing 
well

I may be unspooled 
yarn 

I know that there is calmness at the bottom of it all 
but it takes a lot of practice to burn off the panic and the dread 

and I am busy 
doing my work!

playing chicken 
moving towards failure 

standing near failure 
unspooling the yarn I AM DRINKING DIET COKE

the wind is creaking the house 
and I am sitting near the shabbat candles 

the dishwasher is going
my cat is resting 

I am glad I am not dead 
I have a lot to look forward to 

I did not always feel that way 
I needed to learn how 

I am drinking diet coke
and my sock is on the rug THREE WAYS OF CARING

there are three ways of caring 
about what other people think 

that I can think of
at the moment 

appearance ––  
ear hairs, double chin, dandruff 

personality –– 
annoying, intense, dumb 

choices –– 
the art you make, how you invest, what toothbrush you bought

I have been insecure 
about all of these categories 

at some point 
or another 

they come and go 
depending on whatever 

...I no longer want to be insecure 
about the art I make 

I don't know if that insecurity has been as clear to me 
as it is now 

that I have framed it 
this way 

abracadabra 
alakazam 

ok
it's done 

I will never be insecure about the art I make 
again 

it doesn't matter 
what anyone thinks 

there is cat shit 
smeared on the canvas 

fuck you
:)  SOME THOUGHTS ON WRITING

when you write all day 
it may seem
like there is nothing left to write

when you do not write all day 
it may seem also 
like there is nothing to write 

there is always another thing
to write
and if you feel like you cannot write anymore, then just write something down anyway 

in your notebook
on your keyboard
in the sand 

if there is a wave
and it washes away what you have written 
it is good to feel the pain of it 

throw your notebook in the fire
highlight everything and delete it and then empty the computer trash 
it doesn't matter 

and if your handwriting is illegible  
it's probably for the best 
it doesn't matter

senselessly write the next thing 
when you have no ideas left
and when you have no ideas at all UNLIMITED DEBT

I ate
an apple 

earlier 
today 

my wife had cut into quarters 
and put it in a plastic bag 

and gave me 
it

if ever 
I lose sight 

of how lucky I am 
to have her give me a bag of apple slices 

I deserve to be 
hung 

in the town square
for everyone to see 

"his wife gave him a bag of apple slices 
and he didn't care"

"absolutely he deserved to die 
for that" 

"no 
question" 

"fuck 
him"

lose sight of that
and your life has no value 

your art 
and your money and all of that shit becomes unlimited debt 

you can owe unlimited debt 
with your shit value 

or 
you can owe unlimited debt

to the person 
who gives you apple slices 

quartered
in a plastic bag 
SHARK STORY

I am imagining a worm 
and a particle of dust

I am thinking about confidence 
and fear 

I am wearing a t-shirt 
and sitting in a chair 

I am looking at the keyboard
and the screen 

a shark once bit off
my penis 

I don't talk about it 
often

it is
what it is 

I am a bit hungry
I think I will go downstairs for a snack

in
a bit 
GLUE

I have not been reading as much 
lately 

instead I have been writing in my notebook 
a lot 

I will have to adjust my thinking 
because 

if you don’t read
you become a piece of shit 

life just isn’t 
as good 

the stories on hbo 
are damn good

but somehow 
even the best tv just isn’t the same 

it’s synthetic protein 
–– still protein, but not the top shelf stuff 

I will have to glue my ass to a couch this weekend 
and get back on track 
MY LAST WILL

I am happy to write 
internet poems 

when I die 
I will download them all onto a usb chip 

and bring them
into my coffin 

I don't know why 
I think that is a good idea

it's just what I have decided
to do 
SIMPLE MEGAPHONE

I hope to make things simple 
but that is difficult 

it is very complicated 
to make things simple 

people say they want to –– keep 
things simple 

but I don't think they realize 
how it works 

the complications must be worked out 
in order for things to be simple 

perhaps there is something more interesting 
that I'm not telling you at the moment 

yesterday when I was walking 
down the street 

I imagined the prime minister farting into a pylon 
and thinking it was a megaphone 

I think people would like him more
if he did that 

truthfully 
the world would love him for that 

surely you see what I mean 
about working through the complications 

if only he could focus 
enough 

to do what I described... 
–– things would become simple 10.99 2 ITEM COMBO (WITH RICE OR NOODLES AND CHOICE OF SOUP)

we were at the grocery store today
buying stuff 

there was a hot bar there 
where they had all this chinese food 

we got the two item combo with rice and a soup for 10.99 
to share 

the woman ahead of us said 
"give me the biggest container of won ton soup that you have" 

after we ordered 
Miriam asked me if I was going to write about it later

I said no
and at the time, I meant it

but here I am 
writing about it 

we sat and enjoyed the food 
a homeless person sat beside us, eating soup or something 

a guy walked by with his dog
and some other woman was filming another woman who was sitting on the ground for some reason 

there isn't much else to say about it 
but I was very happy to eat lunch together 

to have some time 
to sit and enjoy a chinese food combo 

with your wife
surrounded by groceries...

I don't know how to explain it 
without sounding hyperbolic 

but –– 
that's the maximum 

I will look forward to having the chance to go back there one day 
maybe when our daughter is born 

we can take her 
there
DEAR INTERNET POEM

mother fucker
writing is a bitch 

the last two days have been fucked
I haven't got jack shit done 

sometimes 
every time you try to write 

you just fuck up your shit 
badly 

because you have no idea 
what the fuck you're doing 

you have to be willing and able to write complete shit 
to move forward 

it is so fucked
–– dealing with shit 

tomorrow 
in the morning 

I will look at what I did today
and 

I will try to get it right 
but for now 

it's so fucked
it's so fucking fucked 

thank you for listening 
dear internet poem 

truly 
I am grateful 

that you are here for me 
every day 

no matter what happens 
with the other shit 

you
dear internet poem 

never fail me 
you are my best friend (and my cat) 

thank you for everything 
dear internet poem 

yours truly, 
JHB
IN HAND

I have been living 
strangely 

the past 
few days 

I am in the rabbit hole 
of trying to figure out this project

throwing matches on piles of gasoline 
there are big flames but they burn out quickly 

but there is always a little chanukah flame 
somewhere you can't see 

and the elements are there
wind, rain all that shit 

and you need to handle it 
or else it will slowly burn you alive 

you will feel smoke in your lungs 
and your stomach will be on fire 

you will have silent 
shocking farts

I am trying to tell the story 
of the idiot tree 

I don't know what that means 
I am just following it 
 
despite how frustrated and irritated I have felt 
I think I am beginning to understand it 

the vision of it 
seems to be here 

you might be wondering 
what you are supposed to do 

when you eventually find this proverbial candle 
and I will tell you 

you have to stick the flame 
up your pee hole 

there is no way around it 
it is the only way to smother the fire 

if you do not do it
it will destroy everything 

your mind, your house
and everything you love 

so here I am 
dick in hand 

staring at the flame 
trying to build up the courage 

to do 
the thing SPRING FEVER

lately 
I have felt on fire 

in my stomach 
and my thoughts are grinding 

when the snow melts after the winter
a lot of things are all rusted  

I feel like a rusted bike gear 
or something 

I am happy that the air is warming 
with the spring 

but 
the spring has a strange evil to it 

what I want right now...
I suppose –– 

I would like to go sit in the woods 
I would like to be near a pine tree and some kind of river

I would like to sit quietly 
with my cat 

it is true 
that I find people exhausting 

and it is good
to be alone 

when it is time
to be 

–– 
alone MIX PACK

the mix pack 
of pudding cups

chocolate
vanilla 

and 
caramel 

they are 
there

they represent 
all that there is 

all that there was
and all

that there ever will 
be

whatever you do 
do not 

look 
at the expiry date

that is all I can say 
for now 

it is not a matter of anything 
it's just what it is 

it is the truth of the matter
and

they are 
thereTHINKING ABOUT POEMS

the point of writing a poem is to find a way to describe something that you are not capable of describing unless you write a poem
a good poem describes something you know but don’t have the ability to explain

a good poem describes an idea that cannot be described without warping ordinary speech 

a good poem must be idiotic, wrong and weird. It must be cheap 

a good poem should be written and read without much effort 

a meal becomes poetic when it becomes something more than the sum total of its ingredients 

if you go to a restaurant and eat a slice of pizza and it reminds you of a time twenty years ago when you were at swimming lessons — the slice has become poetic

you cannot explain how that moment felt but you experience it briefly from eating the pizza slice 

I know that the logic of what I’m saying doesn’t track completely 

and that’s ok

I told you it needs to be idiotic, wrong and weird 

so I have done what I intended 
A REAL FRIEND

I talked to my friend 
this morning

we talked things 
over

it was worth it to be honest 
with one another 

and now we are on the same page 
again 

a real friend 
will not act like a little bitch 

in the face 
of conflict

a real friend 
will hear you out 

and know 
that you are trying to sort things out

you don't get many real friends 
in life 

sometimes 
you tell them what you think 

and they reveal themselves to be 
commie bastards 

and sometimes 
you tell them what you think 

and they think 
that you're the commie bastard 

but 
I suppose 

we are all commie bastards 
at heart

do not be afraid 
to be a stubborn prick 

when the time 
is right

because if you are not that 
then you are not anything 

a real friend 
will know what you're saying 

and it will be 
all good 
CONFLATE EVERYTHING

a crumb
on the ground

next to 
a pool of slime 

***

sometimes 
you begin to say a new word 

and you feel smart
but people know 

that you are saying 
a new word 

the word lately for me 
has been –– conflate 

do not conflate the pop can tab
with the recycling bin 

do not conflate the crumb on the ground 
with the pool of slime 

***

as I was walking earlier 
I was thinking about some stuff 

–– how you do one thing 
is how you do everything ––

it is indisputably and undoubtably 
true 

so
at the end of the day 

I suppose we have no other choice 
than 

to
conflate everything 
I HOPE DAVE IS ALRIGHT

it was an unproductive day 
today 

I have been battling 
some kind of weird sickness 

my brain feels dizzy 
and somehow electrified 

I may have melted my mind 
from being on the computer too much 

I have tried to stick to my notebook
and library book

but I am addicted to this machine 
I am a slug who has being struck by lightning 

***

one time in junior high 
a fight broke out

between the grade eights
and the grade nines 

I was riding my skateboard
and grabbed a pizza pop off the ground 

I tossed it at this guy Wade
and at the same time he tossed a slurpee at my head 

I wonder if I got brain damage 
and it is finally catching up to me 

my friend Dave got a garbage can beat onto his head that day too
hopefully he's alrightDUE IN TWO MONTHS

I was sick 
since last Saturday 

but I am feeling better 
today

sometimes when you are sick 
it seems like you might die 

I got to thinking 
that in ten years 

my kid 
will only be ten 

that made me feel 
pretty young 

I am happy knowing 
that I am going to live 

I am thinking of what I am looking forward to 
living for 

and
the thing I am most excited about 

is having a baby
she is due in two monthsSUN LEFT

I would like to go for a walk 
in the park 

but instead I am sitting here 
looking at my hand

I should have gone earlier 
but now it's almost dinnertime  

so I will have to go 
after we eat 

***

last night, when we were watching tv before bed
I became hungry 

I went downstairs 
and there were a lot of boiled eggs left over from the passover seder 

I microwaved one  
and when I bit into it –– it exploded all over the cabinet and the counter and the ground

I know that sounds like something I would make up
but it happened 

*** 

if you have a hard boiled egg
you should put it in the microwave

if it doesn't explode there
it will explode when you take a bite out of it 

it will burn your tongue 
and seems quite dangerous 

but 
it was craziest thing that's happened to me in a long time 

***

I am looking forward to eating dinner 
I have become very hungry 

thinking about 
that exploding egg 

I am looking forward to going on a walk 
after we eat 

I hope that there is some sun left
when we goHOW TO BE GOOD

if something is good
then it is good

if it is not good
then it is not good 

people will like it 
if it is good 

people will not like it
if it is not good

people are dumb
often 

and you are also 
a dumb person often 

if you are not a dumb person 
often enough 

you will become 
not good 

if you are dumb 
often 

you will be 
good 

become as dumb
as possible 

and then you will be 
good

do not become dumb
and you will remain not goodCOLIC AT THIRTY FIVE

I hadn't been feeling like myself
these past few weeks 

the truth is 
I still have colic at age thirty five  

but I had a better day today 
than I have in a little while

I read 98 pages
of the baby book 

I have been procrastinating reading it
for over a month 

but now that I've gotten into it
I am feeling better

if I do the same tomorrow and the day afterward 
I will have finished the book

and then I will know 
what there is to know 

about calming down 
a crying baby 

afterward 
I should read a book about 

what happens when my wife goes into labour
and I need to drive us to the hospital 

and know what to do 
while she is giving birth 

to 
our baby I FINALLY READ THE BABY BOOK

I finally read 
the baby book 

I procrastinated and 
renewed it three times 

that is the maximum 
amout of times you are allowed to renew a book 

and then I 
binged it in the last two days 

it is due 
tomorrow 

but I did it
and now I feel like less of a pussy ass bitch 

I know what colic is now 
and I have some ideas as to how to soothe a crying baby 

I was thinking of buying some burritos
to practice swaddling 

but I thought maybe that wouldn't be the best idea 
in case

I end up 
eating the baby 

***

tomorrow I will take the book back 
to the library 

and I will try to find 
another one WINDEXING

I thought of writing long sentences here 
like the ones in my journal 

but 
somehow 

it seems impossible 
to do 

I don't know why 
I have the urge to write long sentences and paragraphs 

maybe 
because it is a serious thing to do 

and it is great
to be serious 

but it is also 
incredibly dumb 

a serious person
will windex the bathroom mirror

a serious person 
will not accidentally sneeze on the bathroom mirror after windexing it 

they would cover their mouth 
and not get it all over the place 

they may even hit their head against the cabinet 
as they try to avert their face away from the mirror that they have just windex'd

they may crack their head open 
and become permanently injured and even die 

an unserious person 
may have to windex the mirror twice 

they will look at their reflection 
and see themselves covered in snot 

there is a third possibility 
to consider

imagine that you windex'd the mirror 
and then sneezed on the mirror 

and whacked your head against the cabinet
and cracked your head open 

it is the best of both 
worlds

I know that I veered off into serious bullshit 
with this whole mirror thing 

but 
it is very difficult to hold back a sneeze 

they say you should look at the light 
but I have tried

and 
it doesn't work NOTES ON WISHING

we picked up two pizzas
on the way home 

from taking our cat
to the vet, he has been struggling lately 

after we ate the pizzas 
we walked around the park 

we are trying to take some extra pictures 
of Miriam 

to make sure we have some good ones
so that one day we can remember how she looked, when she was pregnant 

***

we just heard a loud crashing sound 
and went downstairs to see what it was

our cat knocked over an important plate 
it is the one that Miriam's mom uses to put the shabbat candles on each week

it is shattered now
it is broken into many pieces 

...I became hungry 
while we were downstairs cleaning up 

and now I am eating an apple 
and feeling guilty 

***

I will say one more thing
while I am here

I will admit that
when I see the clock at 11:11

I cannot help but make a wish 
it feels involuntary, like a reflex 

and every time 
I end up wishing for the same thing 

I wish for my family
to be okay 

***

I don't know why 
wishing seems dumb 

I try to wish 
as little as possible

perhaps 
it is just a matter of general goal setting

and maybe if I organized those thoughts a bit more
they wouldn't be so desperate to jump at clocks

and 
magic numbers 
WE ARE GOING TO COSTCO ON MONDAY NIGHT

I am hoping to get chicken fingers 
from costco soon 

I hope I can go there at a time 
when it isn't so busy 

so I can eat
in peace

I hope to have extra dipping sauces 
and extra ketchup

I hope to have some fries 
and a soda 

a ginger ale 
or diet coke 

I don't really care
actually, maybe ginger ale 

there isn't much else
I feel like doing 

we probably don't have time to go
until monday night 

I will look forward to it 
until then 
BROWN PANTS

lately 
I have felt like owning a pair of dark brown pants 

I used to have a pair like that 
a long time ago 

I don't know what happened to them 
I must have left them behind somewhere 

I don't know why 
I became fixated on the idea 

this happens sometimes
I get fixated on wanting to own something trivial 

maybe the idea will fade off
or maybe I will just have to go out and buy a pair of pants like that 

I know how pointless it will be 
to own another pair of pants

though maybe they would be good to own 
if I ever shit myself 

maybe if I wear them while writing 
I will be able to finish a novel at a disturbingly fast pace 

next weekend 
my wife said that she wanted to go value village 

when we are there 
I will look and see 

if they have any pants
like the ones I am picturing 

and if they don't 
then I will not own brown pants like that 

that is all I can say
for now 
CONSIDERING SALAMI

we bought a thing of kosher salami 
that I am excited about eating in the coming days 

perhaps I will have a salami sandwich 
or have it for breakfast with some eggs

Miriam wants to have it on a bagel 
on the weekend 

my mother in law already had a few slices
while she was watching tv 

I will see if my cat wants to try some
and maybe we will give a bit to the dogs too

sometimes I get hungry before bed
and if I do, I will go down to the fridge and slice off a piece 

we are making pizza tomorrow night for dinner 
and I even suggested we make one with salami on it 

*** 

while I was writing this
I have been watching my cat 

he spent twenty minutes trying to get his feather toy from under the closet door 
and he finally got it 

now 
he is dragging it around and kicking it and biting it 

he worked very hard
and now he is enjoying the fruits of his labour 

without the hunt 
he is miserable 

I did the math 
and I think it took me ten minutes of work to get the salami 

but that doesn't account for the time it took me to park the car, find the salami in the store, pay for it and drive home
so it seems that we earn similarly, me and my cat –– it evens out in the end THINGS IN THE WORLD

there are many things
in the world 

and 
I suppose I do not care about a lot of them 

it is a luxury 
not having to care 

it is a luxury 
to get to chose what you care about

I care about 
watching hbo 

writing 
and my wife and cat 

and 
my daughter who my wife is carrying 

as I am writing this 
I think they are doing yoga in the other room 

we will watch hbo soon 
after I brush my teeth 

and shut down my computer 
for the night

in the morning 
I will write again 

I will go for a walk 
and make some money from teaching some things to film students 

I will put that money in the bank and for the most part 
we will spend it on food and baby stuff 

there are many things in the world
and as you can see –– my world is very small 

I think I am well suited 
for that I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE COMPUTER SCREEN

I have been looking at the computer screen 
for many, many hours today 

it happens most days
of my life 

but somehow
in this moment, my eyes feel like they have becomes screens themselves 

it seems as they are emitting 
their own brightness 

this does not happen 
after a day of reading 

or writing 
in a notebook

tomorrow 
I will spend some time 

with my notebook
and an actual book 

hopefully it is cloudy 
so my eyes can rest 

I wonder if eyeballs 
are made out of lightning bolts 

or 
if they are the same as stars 

it is all just 
different kinds of light 

I don't actually wonder that 
I guess I am just thinking about it in a weird way 

not to be clever
or odd

but because it is enjoyable 
to doA CUP HOLDS WATER

I am feeling 
slightly like

there is wet concrete 
in the front of my brain 

I am still thinking about form 
and what it means 

there are different form genres 
if something needs to be 

watched in one hour 
or contained to a frameable square 

if there must be groups of two short lines
that fill roughly a page 

if it must be a two or three minute
song 

I can see what Knausgard was saying 
about how important it is

a cup holds water
a house keeps us dry from the rain 

my brain now feels like
it is a baked potato wrapped in tinfoil 

I think I will go downstairs
and get an apple

that has been my favourite snack
lately WE'RE GOOD

as I walked into the street today 
I saw a guy who thinks I'm a bastard

I said hello to him, as I have done before
but he could bring himself to say hello back

it causes him too much pain 
to say hello 

I suppose he isn't the only guy 
who would feel unable to say hello to me 

if they saw me
in the street 

I think at this point it is better to accept it and move on 
then to wonder about it 

the qualms are minor
in the grand scheme

I would be fine to talk these things out 
but I don't think that is what people always want

if you don't resolve the conflict
you can keep it 

it can be yours
forever

it will never abandon you
not like in the way that I did 

these fuckin pussies! 
get a life 

I don't need to be someone
that everyone likes

I am thinking of the people that think I'm a piece of shit 
I am imagining them hanging out 

maybe if I came by 
they would say, okay man, you can hang out with us 

here's a diet coke 
we're good
CONSIDERING SALAMI II

simultaneously I am sitting in my chair 
and I am drinking a sip of water

simultaneously I am giving a fuck
and I am not giving a fuck 

each week
passes

and there is a lot of bad shit that happens
and nothing goes wrong 

my favourite food 
at the moment 

is kosher salami 
from costco 

especially if you fry it
in a cast iron pan 

I should think of sharing it
instead of trying to keep it all for myself 

I am simultaneously giving a fuck
and not giving a fuck 

I am sitting in my chair
and simultaneously drinking a sip of waterDOG EARED THING

I enjoyed sitting on the subway today
and reading a book I got from the library 

the person who had the book before me
left in this strange bookmark 

it is a little cheap brass looking thing 
a paperclip with an arrow, some kind of dog ear 

I thought it was ingenious at first 
because you could mark exactly which line you left off on

when my stop was coming up
I tried to move the damn thing 

but I dropped it twice
when I was trying to clip it onto the line 

and then I kept fidgeting with it 
to get it right on the line 

it was so finicky 
I almost missed my stop 

it was a complete debacle 
I almost had a full breakdown

usually I use a post it note 
as a bookmark 

and starting tomorrow 
I'm going back to them

after what happened on the subway today 
after almost losing my page and missing my stop like that 

I'm never trusting that dog eared thing 
ever again HIS KINDNESS WAS UNPARALLELED

I have a strange feeling
in my stomach 

I was downstairs 
eating salt and vinegar chips 

and then I ate
an apple

I feel calm 
and exhausted

but there is some lingering anxiety 
about something I can't quite place

we had to say goodbye to Jag today
he was Miriam's mom's cat 

I gave him a pat on the head 
for the last time 

his kindness was unparalleled 
he loved to sit on the porch in the sun 

he stood up for our cat
when the dogs would chase him 

he would come stomping towards them
and send them back cowering 

he always stood up 
for the little guy 

even when the little guy
would pounce on him and tackle him for no reason

I saw him
lying in the sun, the day before he got sick

it would have been the last time 
he got to do that 

he will be missed
here at our house 

his kindness 
was unparalleled 

rest in peace
old buddyAPPLE

sometimes, when I don't know what to write
I compulsively go on youtube

I scroll through the videos
and see what's going on 

I just watched a video 
but already, for the life of me I cannot remember what it was 

truly,
I cannot remember 

perhaps I ate too much jalapeño 
at dinner 

perhaps I need to go downstairs 
and eat an apple

I will go do that
one moment 

***

I have returned 
and now I am eating an apple 

I cut it into four slices 
and gave one to Miriam 

she is sick in bed 
and watching youtube with a tissue sticking out of her nose 

I see our cat 
is drinking some water

everyone is relaxing here
we are winding down for the night 

–– god damn it 
I went on youtube again

I didn't even know I was doing it 
I suppose I'll pack it in for the night too SITTING OUTSIDE

I am here 
eating apple slices again 

I was able to read my book 
on the porch, today 

I sat there
and my cat walked around looking at stuff 

I enjoyed the book 
but more so, I felt content sitting there with him and the book and the sun

it is possible 
that it could be the last time 

it is unlikely that it will be the last time 
but it is possible 

like yesterday 
I am here eating apple slices again 

and tomorrow
I hope we can sit outside again, even for ten or fifteen minutes

we will think of our old buddy
who knew better than anyone 

what it meant
to sit in the sunI FORGOT ABOUT IT UNTIL NOW

tomorrow 
I will anticipate 

going on 
a

long 
walk 

I will anticipate 
seeing trees

and stuff
like that

I will anticipate 
reading a book 

***

today 
when I was walking 

I saw an old woman sitting 
on a chair 

outside 
of starbucks

she was staring 
blankly 

she was taking a moment 
to think 

things 
over

***

I was overwhelmed 
briefly 

I was reminded of the times 
I sat and stared blankly like that

thinking things over
trying to put it all together

I saw myself in that old
woman

and I choked up 
a bit

and then I kept walking 
and forgot about it until now MOBILE

we set a bassinet up
at the edge of the bed 

it is comforting to see
it 

the baby will go in there
and she will look at the ceiling 

we will need to get her
the right mobile 

for now
she will stay 

in her mother's 
womb 

I can only imagine 
what strange mobiles 

she has been looking at 
in there 

I was just speaking to my mother 
on the phone 

I don't remember 
anything 

from my time 
in the womb

I don't remember 
my bassinet

or any 
mobiles

I don't even remember
my first memory

I am sitting here 
trying to remember

but I'm really 
not sureTHE FUTURE

I am looking forward 
to waking up tomorrow 

and going on 
my morning walk 

lately 
it has become my favourite thing to do 

I set my alarm 
thirty minutes earlier 

to be closer 
to the sunrise 

I will continue this habit 
as I go into the future 

***
in the future 
I will have a new book to share 

in the future
I will hold my daughter and show her the sun and the clouds

in the future 
I will go to the library with my daughter and she will pick out a book to read

in the future
I will be scratching my head and standing in the middle of nowhere near some dirt and patches of grass

in the future 
I will be wearing a strange pair of sneakers 

in the future 
I will write something down in my notebookI WILL FIND SOME MUD TO STAND IN

I would like to go
out of the city 

sometime
soon

I would like to go
stand

in the trees
and the mud

I may not get the chance 
this weekend 

but maybe 
next weekend 

I can go 
drive somewhere 

like
that 

in the meantime 
I will go to the park 

near 
our house 

I will try to find 
a strange path 

to walk
down

I will try to find 
a strange tree

to look 
at

I will find some mud 
to stand in

and I will look
at my shoes

as they sink
into the mud
I KEPT GOING AHEAD WITH THINGS

I am thinking 
of my stomach 

that is where the strangeness 
usually is 

it is usually 
prickly and acidic 

not always 
but a lot of the time 

in a way 
it is like it controls my thoughts

it makes them move 
quickly 

it is difficult to relax
for me

instead
I would rather focus on something 

like writing
or editing 

I don't think I will overcome it
I don't think that I want to 

I can remember it 
since I was a kid 

I left class
and went to the office

and told them 
I had a stomach ache 

but I knew 
I couldn't explain it right 

so I kept going 
ahead with things 

I think of all of the times 
sitting at a keyboard

or with a pencil 
and a notebook 

still trying to explain it 
some days are better than others 

I know I will never get to the bottom of it
but that is okay 

I will keep going 
ahead 

with 
things BREAKING A STICK IN HALF

I wanted to write about going to get my hair cut
today 

it went 
well

usually I just cut my hair at home
but for some reason, this time I wanted to go to a place

Sam's Barber Shop
next to the Pet Valu 

he did a great job
I would like to go back one day 

I walked through the park 
on the way home 

I found a stick on the ground 
and snapped it in half

and then tossed it 
into a puddle 

it felt good to break the stick in half 
for no reason 

it doesn't affect anything
if you break a stick in half

I will go back to the park 
and break another stick like that 

again 
one day 
I AM SENTIMENTAL TO IT

sometimes 
when you write

you sit
and do nothing 

like
now

I am sitting
here in my chair 

looking at weird markings
on my desk 

without even realizing
that I'm doing it 

I just cut a thread 
off of my wallet 

I then stood up 
and walked around my office here

I may have looked out the window
it was a blur

now I am sitting again 
and I read some messages from my wife

she is on her way home from work now
I am telling her how our cat was this afternoon 

I have noticed that I have become 
sentimental 

about 
sitting with a notebook and being not sure what to write

when I look back 
I am happy that this is how I spent my life 

I looked up the word
sentimental 

"of or prompted by feelings of
tenderness, sadness or nostalgia" 

ok
that is fine

I am sentimental 
to it LIME SPARKLING WATER

I have a can of sparkling water
there is a lime twist to it 

I am happy to be drinking
this soda

I am here sitting at my desk
enjoying a soda pop

I am thinking of the future
anticipating what is to come 

I am looking forward 
to having time 

to 
focus

in this moment
I have time

to 
focus

but somehow
I am wondering about tomorrow 

and wondering if I will have time
to drink a soda

and sit at my desk
and

focus
on doing a bit of writing 

I don't have a solution
it is the way it goes 

it is
what 

it 
is CONSIDERING FAMILY

it is strange 
to have family 

to me
nothing has been as strange 

as
that

I am not great 
at it 

siblings
and siblings in law

aunts
and uncles 

all that shit 
I'm not good at it 

for the most part
I feel like I cannot be myself 

around
family 

for the most part 
I feel misunderstood and criticized 

for the most part
I feel that I misunderstand and criticize

I am unsure
about it all 

I am having a family of my own 
soon

I will try to make sure that my daughter feels ok
about it all 

even if I am unable 
I hope that she will TOMORROW AFTERNOON

I was just feeding my cat
and making sure

that 
he had his medication

now 
I am looking forward to getting some rest

I will watch some tv
and then

I will close my eyes
and 

eventually 
I will fall asleep

with the window 
open 

tonight
I am so exhausted 

that I have remembered
how much of a luxury it is

to have
a bed 

and
a roof 

the reason I am so tired
is that we were up very late last night

talking 
about

family 
stuff

***

tomorrow afternoon 
we are going to costco

I am looking forward to it being 
less busy there

than 
usual 

I am looking forward to getting some food
for 

our 
fridge 

I am looking forward 
to being there

tomorrow 
afternoon

but for now
I will get

some 
sleep 
THE GRASS WILL STAND UPWARD

each day 
a different thing happens 

I don't know 
if I have anything else to say about that 

instead 
I will sit here patiently 

the screen glowing 
on my face in the dark 

tomorrow 
a different thing will happen 

the sun will go 
on a tree 

and a cloud will go
across the sky 

there will be many bugs 
in the grass

and the grass 
will stand upward

as 
it does HOW IT WENT

I went to the library 
earlier this afternoon 

I went 
to drop off some books 

and 
I picked up a new one

I already read thirty pages of it 
when I got home 

I am happy that I got 
it 

you never know 
which book will grab your attention 

I am hoping to read more
tomorrow 

when I take the subway 
downtown 

***

for dinner 
we cooked some salmon on the barbecue 

and some potatoes 
and made a salad

we ate it 
outside 

under 
the sun 

now I am sitting 
here at my desk

remembering 
the afternoon 

and how
it went 

***

I forgot to mention 
when I was at the library 

they gave me a new card
because mine was so worn out

that it wouldn't even scan
into the machine

any -- 
moreBASEBALL GAME

we are going to the baseball game
I will return later and describe how it went 

***

I enjoyed sitting there
watching the game 

many of the innings came and went 
without advancing the score

while I sat
I thought of the book I have been reading 

the feeling of the book and its messages 
remained 

sometimes I caught myself staring at nothing
I'm sure from the outside it looked like I was focused on the game

but often I was floating in the ether 
lost in thought 

it was good to go 
to the baseball game

even though 
we got home a bit later than I would have liked I WILL NOTICE THE NEXT ROCK I SEE

I swept along the garage 
cleaning out the old leaves 

I found a cheese 
stick thing

I found a green circle thing
I found an enter key 

now
when I walk along the garage 

I am happy to see
the rocks

it is good to clean things up
and get them into a way that you are happy with 

then you can appreciate them
in a new way 

and you can see the rocks 
better

I have always liked rocks
they are unbelievable 

they are powerful
they are everywhere 

I will look forward to the next time 
I see a rock 

I will notice 
the next rock I see 
CONTINUING

I am happy that things are going
the way that they are

I am able to write a poem like this
each day

I am able to record videos on my camera 
each day

I am able to spend time with my cat and my wife
each day

our car is running well 
and the weather has become warm 

I am writing as good of poems 
as I ever need to

I am making as good of videos 
as I ever need to 

now 
all there is to do 

is 
to continue REMAIN INTERESTED

I am not sure that I am interested in writing about anything that is interesting 

I am not sure that I am interested in writing anything intelligent 

I am more interested in something else 

I am not sure what it is 

if I was sure what it is I would likely become disinterested in it 

I am interested in making things without thinking about them 

it makes it difficult to feel comfortable

but that is great

sometimes I think that I should change 

but it is impossible 

and instead 

each day 

I have to continue 

to learn 

confidence 

***

the way to learn confidence 

is to remain interested –– 

and to be honest with yourself 

about what 

you are interested

in 
THE INJURY

when I was sweeping up the leaves 
last weekend 

I got a blister on the bottom of 
my thumb 

the skin peeled upward 
in a strange way 

each day the skin has grown back 
a small amount 

it is impossible to understand
how skin understands 

what 
to do 

how does it know
how to grow the right amount 

to cover up
the injury 

it seems impossible 
to think 

that it knows
because 

I 
know 

but it must be
that exact reason 

it is impossible to understand
that you are also your body 

more accurately 
I should phrase it differently 

it is impossible to understand 
that I am also my body 

I will try not to think too much 
about it 

the best thing to do 
is probably 

to make sure 
to keep doing exercise 

that is understanding 
enough 
TELEPATHIC LIPOSUCTION

I sat at my desk
for most of the day 

I had the discipline 
to sit

but I did not have
focus 

it seems as though 
I accomplished nothing

I need liposuction 
telepathically 

or 
telepathic liposuction 

I tried walking it off
–– I went to the library 

I drank espresso 
next to traffic 

I tried to be there 
but I was somewhere else 

somewhere 
between the coffee heat and the exhaust 

I spent the rest of the afternoon 
processing my confusion 

in my journal 
while sitting with my cat outside 

afterward I read some chapters of a book 
I was fascinated by them 

but still 
I felt embittered 

about 
myself 

I know that tomorrow 
at a certain point –– it will shift 

and I will feel 
more like myself 

but I suppose 
I had a difficult time

getting there 
today AT SOME OTHER TIME EARLIER

I don't always know 
what is going on 

in
the world 

today 
for instance 

we went
to eat ice cream 

and I didn't know about 
anything

except
the ice cream

that 
we were eating 

one scoop was vanilla 
and the other scoop 

was some fruit 
kind 

it was mango 
or passion fruit 

or something 
like that 

we were eating the ice cream
and I didn't even know what flavour it was 

now I am sitting here
near the window 

I am looking at the black sky 
and the shadows

I suppose 
that there are also street lights there 

going along 
the road 

I don't know much else
about the world

even the moon 
is nowhere to be found 

even the moon 
is trying to remember 

what kind of ice cream 
it was eating 

at some other time
earlier A ROOM THAT STRANGERS WILL ENTER

it is difficult 
to learn 

how to gain 
confidence 

I think
that I have gotten better at it 

I got better at it
because I tried 

to get better
at it 

now that I have some confidence 
I am hoping to share my work with more people 

I think that there are people out there 
that will like my work 

I would be happy for that connection 
to be made 

***

I am thinking of a time 
when I visited home

my mom had an art show
at a coffee shop

I was lucky to be there 
to help her set up all of her paintings 

mostly 
they were paintings of flowers 

I saw 
that it takes courage

to put your pictures up
in a room 

that strangers
will enter 

I will have to now think 
of invitationsTHINGS ARE NOT SOLELY THE WAY THAT THEY ARE

it is good to go 
to a remote place 

when you are there
it may feel normal 

but when you return
to the place you ordinarily are 

it will be good 
to have been

in 
the remote place 

***

it is easy to forget
that things 

are not solely 
the way 

that
they are 

***

I would recommend 
that you pack an apple

and 
a bottle of water

and a camera
in case you want to take a picture 

of a cloud 
or a tree 

that you 
notice 

***

because it is easy 
to forget 

that things are not 
solely 

the way 
that they are 
MY GRAND AMBITION

my grand ambition 
is

to one day
have a small cabin 

in
the woods

to walk through the trees 
and notice a strange bird 

to own 
a firearm 

in case
necessary 

to write something down 
in my notebook

and never return 
to what I had written 

to see 
the snow and the leaves and the pollen 

and the sun
and the moon

and all of that 
stuff 

it is a good thing
to think of 

for 
one day 

it is a good thing 
to think of

for 
eventually 
HAVING EATEN MCDONALDS

I am not wondering 
about much

I am sitting 
this evening 

having eaten mcdonalds 
for supper 

enjoying 
each bite 

very 
much 

I would like to always have the chance
to enjoy mcdonalds

every 
now 

and 
again 

to eat some fries 
and ketchup

a hamburger 
and ketchup 

some chicken 
and soda 

ice cream
coffee

all that stuff 
that they have 

it is all 
great

I have always loved 
going to mcdonalds ADVICE TO MY YOUNGER SELF

it is good 
to be busy

with something
you care about 

what you need to do 
is practice 

caring 
about

whatever 
stuff 

if you do not care
about what you are doing 

then you will be miserable 
and you will make everyone else 

miserable
as well 

if someone convinced you
that what you care about 

is stupid 
then you need to find the strength 

to laugh at their absurd 
idiocy 

that is part
of the practice

don't worry 
about

what you think 
other people

will
think

instead 
finish your work 

and show them what you care about 
and then they will tell you what they think

it will be different 
than what you think they will think 

regardless of what they think 
good or bad 

my advice remains –– 
do what you care aboutTO SIMPLIFY

often 
I write illegibly in my notebook 

for 
no reason 

I try to get to the end 
of my thoughts

but there is no end
to it 

even when it seems like that is it 
there is always another 

even when it seems like the thoughts are about nothing
when it seems like they are so banal 

a thread is pulled
and there are even more thoughts 

I like to write as much as I can 
about as little as possible 

when I read a sentence that is too complicated
I find myself scratching my head

and going to the fridge
for a snack 

it is very complicated 
to simplify things

but it is good
for things to be simple 

if you can simplify something 
for yourself

or for a friend
I think it is a good way to be helpful 

it is a good thing
to consider REMEMBER TO WRITE POORLY

in this moment 
I am unsure what to write 

I have been sitting here for some time
my thoughts are unclear 

I have lost sight
of allowing myself to write poorly 

as 
a discipline 

in 
itself 

I have to remember 
to write poorly 

I have to remember
not to care 

as an antidote 
for caring 

to not allow
myself 

to try to be 
more

than
what I already am 

my thoughts are scattered 
the sun is setting behind me 

I have not written a great poem 
but I am happy to have reminded myself 

to let go 
of it HOLDING THE CAMERA AGAIN

I am thinking of going to the camera store 
tomorrow

to look at 
the cameras

it is always good
to have a camera 

that you are happy 
with 

you need to find one 
that you enjoy using 

you need to find one 
that feels right in your hands 

I am thinking back 
to when I was fifteen or so 

I was filming 
my friend 

as he did
stuff

I ran into the street
to get a wider shot

and I got hit by a truck
and fractured my hip 

since then 
I usually let someone else hold the camera 

but lately 
I have been enjoying 

holding the camera 
again 
THE BIRD THAT I SAW

I was standing at the counter
eating potato chips

and thinking
about what I was doing 

I was thinking about standing there 
eating potato chips 

I am thinking of the bird I saw in the park 
this morning 

he was plucking a worm
from the grass

standing 
with the worm in his beak 

I am happy to be the same 
as the bird that I saw 
UNKNOWN STRUCTURE

today
I sat in the dentist's chair 

they played the news 
on a screen 

while the hygienist 
scraped at my teeth 

I saw that some kids in Winnipeg got hurt
while on a field trip 

the police woman 
explained it vaguely 

she said that she did not know what structure 
that they were standing on 

***

someone lit a firework off 
on a bus 

the hygienist stopped what she was doing 
and we watched the footage 

she went back 
to scraping my teeth 

at the end of the appointment
the dentist told me that I am clenching my jaw a lot and it's messing up my gums 

it isn't because of the kids
or the fireworks 

it is just because 
of whatever I have been doing SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE

somewhere along the line 
I got it in my head that writing poems is stupid 

and that writing them made me seem like a fool 
and a loser 

but I have always loved 
writing poems

even 
despite myself 

when I was younger 
I used to study the great poets

but I never read poems anymore
now I just write them 

now I am thinking of 
sushi

since my wife has been pregnant we haven't had it much 
not like how we used to 

I suppose I've been avoiding it
in solidarity

not because of altruism 
but because of codependence 

and codependence, like poetry 
seems to be something that I also can't help

and something 
that I don't understand 

laying these things out 
here in this poem –– is good 

it is a way of 
putting the ideas down to rest 

I will begin to reconsider the idea 
that writing poems is stupid 

and that writing them 
will make me seem 

like a fool 
and 

a 
loser SOME OF THE TIME I AM OK AT IT

here I am 
sitting on the front steps with my cat

we are enjoying the breeze 
and the shade

a bird swoops past and 
he at once 

snaps upward 
and tries to nab it 

that would have been a great lunch 
instead we will stick to kibble 

we are watching the leaves in the wind 
and we are not thinking of much 

eventually we will go back inside 
and return to clicking around the computer 

it will feel like time is running out
when we are clicking around the computer 

–– it is complicated 
to be present 

some of the time 
I am ok at it 

and other times 
I am not here at all
I CAN SEE ITS FACE

last night we were driving 
and my wife pointed out the moon 

"I can see its face"
she said 

I looked up and thought 
–– oh yah that guy

for a moment 
I thought I knew the guy 

as I looked back towards the road 
I realized 

that I'm not sure I know
that guy 

in a way 
it is similar to seeing yourself in the mirror 

somehow 
despite knowing 

how well you know that guy 
you are still left unsure 

it is not a question 
that needs an answer 

but I will say 
that it is good

to pay attention 
to the moon 

not for any reason 
in particular 

it is just a good thing
to do SITTING CURIOUSLY AND STUBBORNLY

sitting curiously 
and stubbornly 

in my ego 
and without it 

I am considering what 
I can muster 

    I am considering 
what is musterable
 
–– enjoy your life 
in whatever way you can 

–– do not 
over eat 

    the library is open until eight thirty this evening 
but my hold still has not come in

I have been checking their website compulsively 
I am waiting for a book by a dead guy to arrive on the shelf 

I would like to read the book by the dead guy 
to see what I can get from it 

    earlier today 
after I got off the subway 

I threw both of my pens in the garbage
for no other reason 

than 
they were both out of ink 

    remembering this 
I have taken two other pens from my drawer 

and put them 
into my bag 

in case I need to write anything down 
tomorrow ON SALE

it is good 
to write less

like a sale 
at the store 

it is good
to save

it is good
to get more for less

already I have said too much 
already I have repeated myself 

I want to offer you a great deal in reading this poem 
but in the end you will see

the reason
it is on sale 
WAIT QUIETLY FOR THE BILL

we went to eat at a restaurant
close to our house 

it was great
they had chicken shawarma, hummus, pickles and all kinds of stuff like that 

I was happy to eat there
with my wife 

I am happy to have had the opportunity 
to eat at a restaurant today 

we are very lucky 
every time we get to sit at a table 

and look at a menu
and order something to eat 

to have the money 
to pay for it 

to have the time 
to sit and take our time and eat the food 

to sit and wait quietly 
for the bill

we brought home a lot of leftovers 
I am looking forward to enjoying them –– tomorrow 

I WILL DO THE SAME

when I was writing earlier this afternoon 
I tried to look closely 

at 
the belief 

that I see myself as a weak 
artist 

because I do not make that much money 
or have that big of an audience 

I wonder what I have against 
artists that don’t make much money 

I wonder what I have against 
artists that don’t have much of an audience 

I wonder what I have against 
myself 

there is a discipline that comes along 
with being an unsuccessful artist 

despite your constant self criticism 
you find a way to keep yourself afloat 


you sit with your doubt  
and you find a way to move forward

perhaps I see myself as a weak artist 
because I know that inevitably I cannot prevent myself from dying 

perhaps that is what 
is beneath the rock 

I don’t know if I will care much about the art I made 
when I am going to die 

instead I will care about saying goodbye to my family
and my friends 

and at the end of the day 
I will care about saying goodbye 

to 
myself 

try to imagine the conversation you will have with yourself 
when you are going to die 

try to make art 
to honour that connection 

try to make art 
to honour the times that you were there 

for 
yourself 

try to accept 
that it will all end 

and 
I will do the same FEW THINGS COMPARE

I am enjoying my life 
sitting here 

listening to music 
on my headphones 

and drinking
a can of pineapple flavoured sparkling water 

even when the can is empty 
and I don’t know what song to listen to next 

even when my chair is broken 
and my headphones are broken 

I will still find a way 
to sit 

and enjoy 
listening to some music 

regardless of what is going on 
it has always been one of the great ways to enjoy life

few things 
compare 
I STILL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HER

I have taken a shower and clipped my 
Fingernails 

Now it is time to sit and 
Write 

Lately 
I have been thinking about my wife 

I have been thinking about how things were 
And about how things are 

In a way 
Nothing has changed 

I still look forward to seeing her 
Every day 

I noticed that 
After I clipped my fingernails 

And went in
To the shower 

Before I sat down 
To writeCONSIDERING MILLIMETRES

Yesterday 
I capitalized all of the lines in my poem 

I don’t know what the point of it is 
I think it looks worse and is illogical 

But I will do it again 
Today 

I would like to spend some time sitting and breathing 
At some point 

Capitalizing these lines… 
It seems like a way to avoid that 

Refining pointless 
Details 

In my line of work 
Considering millimetres is dumb 

Details 
Are overrated

I don’t know if I will 
Continue 

Capitalizing these lines 
Instead I will consider sitting and breathing 

As a way 
To be GOD BLESS THE PUBLIC LIBRARY

I have some library books 
that are due soon 

I was anxious that my wife was going to go into labour 
before I had a chance to return them

my wife's due date 
is tomorrow 

when a library book is due 
it must be returned 

when a baby is due 
is will be taken out 

in a way 
it is like you are borrowing the baby 

from 
itself 

you have to take good care of it 
until it is time to return them 

if you rip any of the pages
or spill something on it 

you will have to pay a large fine 
and lose your membership 

I know this metaphor 
is mostly useless 

and I am drawing a random connection 
between two things that have nothing in common 

but I suppose it is helpful 
to route my anxiety 

through the public library 
for now A CUP OF COFFEE OR A SLICED APPLE

I am sitting at my desk 
and wearing my slippers 

I am happy to be 
sitting here 

in a way 
I would like to sit here forever

taking a break 
every so often 

to enjoy a cup of coffee
or a sliced apple 

taking a walk in the park 
talking to my wife 

driving her to the hospital 
to deliver a baby 

sitting with my cat
outside 

that is the extent of it 
more or less 
OUTSIDE OF TIME

I have not taken time 
to write senselessly, lately 

I am due for that 
tomorrow 

I will sit with my notebook
and write senselessly

I know that it will not bring any real satisfaction 
but it is what I have to do 

for some 
reason 

I know that I will write 
about my idea of what the future will be 

and 
what I think is important about the past 

sometimes it is difficult to write outside of time 
and other times it is simple 

for me a lot of the time 
the goal is to find a way to write outside of time 

it doesn't matter to me
whether or not it is some version of the truth or some version of bullshit 

I would like to be a strong writer
in that regard 

I THINK THAT IT IS GOOD

it is good 
I don’t know what exactly 

but I think 
that it is good 

for instance it is good to have air conditioning 
and it is good to sit outside in the outside air 

it is good to see a cloud in the sky
and it is good when the sky is covered by a lot of clouds 

it is good when it seems like nothing is happening 
and also it is good when it seems like there is a lot going on 

I think 
that it is good 

I went towards the bottle of mouthwash 
and I swished it around in my mouth 

and then I drank some coffee that I had left over 
from this morning 

and now I am drinking what is left 
from a can of raspberry sparkling water from lunch 

yesterday for lunch 
I ate two muffins 

and 
a cup of instant bone broth 

tonight with dinner 
I will have some diet coke 

I think 
that it is good 

I don’t know what exactly 
but 

I think 
that it is good 
IT ISN'T MUCH

imagining that there is nothing 
is difficult 

or to phrase it more accurately  
I should say –– 

it is difficult to imagine 
nothing 

I try to do it 
every now and again 

it is unimportant 
to understand nothing 

it is obvious 
that there is nothing 

it is easy to think 
that there is nothing 

every once in a while 
it seems like there is something 

it is more difficult to understand and 
it is more difficult to hold the thought 

especially 
when you have imagined nothing 

I do not think any of this is very profound 
or notable 

it is only what I am thinking of
it isn't much WHEN OUR NUMBER IS CALLED

I would like to write thoughtfully 
but I know that lately my thoughts have been ahead of me 

We have a baby on the way 
We are not panicking but we are anxious as we are waiting here at the deli counter 

When our number is called we will need to rely on whatever faith we are able to 
still most of it will be out of our control 

Faith can be a simple idea 
Sometimes it helps to remove any religious and spiritual connotations 

And to think of it only as a way of trying to accept 
what will inevitably happen 

We have no idea what will happen 
ever 

but we can award ourselves the courage to believe  
that it will be good 

and that we will return home 
as a new family WHAT WE ORDINARILY DO

today 
we went to triage 

because we were unsure 
if Miriam's water had broken or not 

while we were at the reception
an alarm went off

and all of the nurses ran into a room 
down the hall

I don't know if I would have what it takes to do that job 
even in that moment, watching them, I had to gather a lot of strength to keep it together

I thought of my dad 
and his brother

who both work in hospitals 
and I tried to be like them 

Miriam's water hadn't broken
but her fluids were a bit low 

they will induce her 
tomorrow 

and it seems 
she will give birth the day after that 

in the meantime 
we will do what we ordinarily do 

we will go on our usual walk 
and we will make pizza for dinnerCONTRACTIONS

I was frying a cheese blintz on the stove
when my wife's contractions began 

she paced around the living room
trying to breathe

her mother sat at the table
cutting a watermelon 

and organizing the pieces into a tupperware
and then she wrote an email on her iPad 

we only talked a little 
before realizing there was no need 

now my wife is sitting on the couch 
and we are being quiet 

it seems like labour has begun 
and we will be parents soon YOUR LABOUR

There was construction in the building and you asked if there was a parrot in the wall matching your labour pains 

Deck Wars was playing on mute behind you while they put in the epidural 

After they put the epidural in you said, “my butt is tingly already.” 

You lay in the bed and were quiet and held onto the railing for most of the night

You were kind to all of the nurses and doctors that came to help 

You were brave and you were strong
NORA

Nora Libbie Gold-Barsky
Born 1:35AM 
June 23rd, 2023

Seven pounds 
Five ounces 
My daughter THE THIRD DAY OF YOUR LIFE

Today, Nora, was the third day of your life 
you slept on my stomach and we watched hbo 

you are kind and calm 
you are sensitive and understanding  

your mother sings to you often 
she has an impossible amount of love to give you 

being with you these past three days 
has brought me a sense of fulfillment that transcends anything I’ve known before 

I feel finally 
like I am where I am meant to be OUR BABY DAUGHTER

today we walked 
with our baby daughter

the sun was a bit hot 
and we became worried

there was mud on the ground
and we became worried

I can see that she has a strong
and resilient spirit 

I can see that she might be a bit of a diva 
and that she is very understanding of people and their shortcomings 

I know that is a lot to think 
about someone who only learned how to blink earlier this afternoon 

but that is what it seems like 
to me 

I have been falling in love with this little baby 
for a few days now 

even when she cries 
I feel in love with her cry

usually when people cry 
I find it annoying 

but not her
not our baby daughter LACTATION CONSULTANT

we went to an appointment at the lactation consultant 
earlier 

we learned a lot 
and got some help 

I asked the nurse there
what people did before formula 

if they couldn't produce
enough milk 

she didn't answer 
and I found myself asking again 

she looked at me and said 
that the infant mortality rate was a lot higher 

if I was to reorganize our government 
I would reroute the entire tax budget into the hospitals 

everything else 
could be left alone 

it isn't that I have a grievance with the way things are 
it is just that I am very grateful for everything the hospitals have done for us 

and 
our baby 

I think that the more resources the hospitals have
to help anyone who needs to be there 

the 
better 

we will return to the hospital again next week
for a follow up 

and I am very grateful
for that 
BEYOND THE DIAPER

I have been watching my wife 
become a mother 

she is taking perfect care
of our daughter 

I never had any doubts 
that she would

I know that our daughter will always look up to her 
I can see it already 

and 
I feel like I will always look up to our daughter

she is heroic 
in how she seizes every moment with total presence 

when I look at her 
I feel like I am connected to something that is beyond spirituality 

beyond god 
and beyond love 

it transcends 
all of that shit 

it goes beyond
the diaper WHATEVER WAY SHE SEES FIT

she hates it when we change her diaper
she becomes inconsolable 

I don't know why 
maybe because it is cold on her butt

she screams at a higher register than usual 
like she is being terrorized 

I get the impression 
that in her mind getting her diaper changed is the worst thing that has ever happened to her in her life 

and it might very well
be

and what's worse is that it keeps happening 
over and over again 

it's true that going to bathroom 
is a strange thing 

truly 
it is a bizarre and terrifying experience 

I suppose realizing that the milk that made you so happy 
has now been processed through your body 

and has decomposed into vile excrement 
is a brutal measure of reality 

she is right 
trying to comprehend the change from one end to another is a lot to handle

she is right to scream
until all of the blood in her entire body has collected into her face 

I don't know if anyone is capable of fully reconciling the idea 
but in time I hope she will become more used to it 

in the meantime she deserves to express herself 
in whatever way she sees fit HER LAUNDRY IS IN THE DRYER NOW

as I have sat down to write
I have remembered 

that I have to go downstairs and flip
the laundry 

if it was my laundry
I would ignore it

but it's for 
my daughter

so I should go deal with it
–– one moment 

ok 
her laundry is in the dryer now

it is more difficult to change her than I would have thought 
she keeps her elbows and knees locked at impossible angles 

she is stronger 
than I would have imagined 

and it is true 
that I am intimidated by her 

I saw that the moment she was born
I could see that she is entirely delicate 

and simultaneously 
much more powerful than I pretend to be SHE IS TRYING ON ALL KINDS OF EXPRESSIONS

I am sitting here
with my daughter sleeping in her bassinet

I have often sat to write 
and have been unable to think of most anything other than myself 

and now 
I am wondering what I can write for her 

what can I write that will be helpful for her 
or that will mean something to her 

I think that all I can do for her 
is to try to write authentically 

to not try to be more 
than what I am 

that is what she has been teaching me 
sleeping in her bassinet 

or this morning when I held her and we looked out the window 
together 

I saw that she is complete 
and I hope that she doesn't feel the need to be more than that

that is how I felt 
–– somehow I felt the need to be extraordinary 

and in doing so
I lost sight of myself 

she is beginning to wake up now 
she is trying on all kinds of expressions 

stretching her arms 
and squeaking 

I want her to know that she is enough 
and always will be 
LEARN HOW TO WRITE

it seems that I have to learn how to write again 
not that I ever really knew 

I am off in a cloud somewhere 
wiping milk off our baby’s cheek 

I thought of a joke today 
while I was eating a hot dog that I had microwaved

–– I don't understand why everyone got so mad at the creator of harry potter for saying what she did 
I thought she was jk

I was happy to sit and eat that hot dog 
while thinking of that joke 

it is quiet for now 
everyone is fed and sleeping 

I suppose this time to sit 
and be with my thoughts 

is all I ever wanted 
from writing 

it doesn't always matter 
if it's ten minutes or ten hours 

I will take what I can get 
and write for myself
IT JUST ISN’T APPLE SEASON

most of the apples 
in the bag that I bought 

are soft 
and bruised 

I thought I’d picked a good bag
but apparently I hadn’t 

it just isn’t apple season 
my mom in law said

she has been more focused on oranges 
and watermelon lately 

and 
rightfully so 

I am looking at one of these apples again 
I have sliced away the bruising and 

in the background I am hearing my daughter screaming 
but it is a phantom cry 

it took a long time to calm her 
this evening 

at first it seems cute 
when she screams profusely 

and then it seems funny 
and then it becomes sad and I get angry

it seems that she needs to sense my defeat
in order to become calm 

she screamed until I did not think about writing 
or work or my haircut or anything

eventually I lay her on her back 
and balanced her on my stomach and gave her my pinky finger  

once she knew I had surrendered my full attention to her 
she became quiet and I felt the gas bubbling in her stomach as she slept 

what did you think having a daughter was going to be?
she asked me 

I lay there defeated
until my wife returned from her bath 

and 
when I went downstairs for an apple 

I remembered what my mom in law said earlier
–– it just isn’t apple seasonA DEVIL AND A MONKEY

I once went to visit you
when you moved to Los Angeles   

you wore your red fleece sweater
and we went to the grocery store to look at snacks

while we walked there you thought it was funny to pretend that you were going to cut my head 
off 

we have a baby now
she is lying on my legs while you are in the bath 

she began to cry 
so I held her and she told me that she is unsure if she wants to be a devil or a monkey 

I told her that to be a person 
you have to be both a devil and a monkey 

she stopped crying 
then 

we looked at one another 
and I saw her face in a new way 

eventually you returned from the bath 
and you took her 

you are buying a new stopper for the bath on the internet  
because ours doesn’t actually fit 

we have been in love 
for some years now 

I still feel like you are my new girlfriend 
even though you are my wife AN IMPOSSIBLE AND CHRONIC FEELING

even though I am writing
I find myself wishing that I had more time to write

it is an impossible 
and chronic feeling 

I forget how to write in a way 
that feels satisfying 

this weekend I will print the poems I wrote this week
including this one 

I will sit in my chair 
and I will read them 

I will think about the difference of what they say
and what they intended to say 

I will try to accept them for what they are 
and then I will move on to writing a new one 

maybe it isn’t about having time to write
instead it’s about having the focus 

I suppose the advice I want to give myself 
is this –– 

do what you can focus on 
everything else is bullshit FROM AFAR IT IS ONLY AN EAR

one day 
I would like to buy a special type of lens for my camera 

it is a type of lens that makes it so that you can look at things
extremely closely 

I was thinking about it 
because earlier this week 

when we were out on a walk 
my wife filmed my ear to show all of the wax in it 

you could see it ok
but I wonder what it would have been like if we had a special macro lens 

it is good to look at things as closely as possible 
it is a good way of appreciating what may seem mundane 

from afar 
it is only an ear

but looking closely 
there is a lot to find DIGESTING THE MILK

after all these years 
of being myself

I wonder if it has ever been any more complicated 
than 

milk
and gas

I can feel how my daughter’s skull has hardened 
her hair is filling out and her limbs are growing 

but the need for milk and the difficulty of digesting it 
remains 

me, you and the next guy 
we’re all just digesting the milk 

screaming 
in between 

laughing dumbly 
at things we cannot even see 

perhaps there is no need to think
that there is anything more than that 
THE APPLE TASTE

sometimes when I eat an apple 
it gets a strange texture that I love

often you can taste that texture 
in a dried apple 

and sometimes 
that taste comes in a real apple 

I know some people think a lot 
about what is going on in the world 

reading all kinds of interesting things 
and being able to write about it  

but for me 
writing is different

it is about emptying the tank 
and focusing on as little as possible 

until 
I come up with something 

I don’t know how to explain 
what it is 

it is just 
something

I often feel self conscious about the value of what I write
but I always keep going ahead 

trying to find 
the apple taste 
MY CAT

sometimes when I finally sit down to write
my cat decides to jump onto my desk 

he walks across my keyboard 
pushes his head against the monitor 

and opens the desk drawer
with his paw

he did it today 
so I walked with him downstairs to the fridge

and served him a quail 
egg 

it has meant a lot to me 
to have a cat like him 

I consider him my best friend 
in the world 

I hope that he knows how much that I care about him 
I hope that he knows how brave he is 

I am supposed to go home to visit my family sometime in the next few months
I need to bring my daughter there to meet everyone 

but the truth is I don't want to go 
because I don't want to leave my cat 

I don't want to be away from him
even for one day

he is sleeping now in his cat tree
my best buddy of all time YOU HAD TURNED THIRTY THREE YEARS OLD

today was your birthday 
when I was at work you texted me 

“She just fell asleep. That was the toughest round yet I think. 
I had to cry with her for a while because she wouldn’t stop”

when I came home Nora was downstairs with your mother 
you had your hair in a towel

you were watching tv and pumping milk 
you had turned thirty three years old 

you are pumping milk again now
Nora is sleeping in the bassinet beside you 

we tried to show you how much we love you
by spending our money and drawing you cards 
 
but we aren’t able to explain ourselves 
to the full extent 

still 
I think you know that our world revolves around you 

soon another year will pass
in what will seem like only a few days 

you are sleeping now and I am trying to calm Nora 
I hope you will be able to get some rest 
NEW MEMORY

I got to spend some good one on one time  
with my daughter today

I set her bassinet up on my desk 
she slept until she got fussy 

I changed her diaper a few times
I gave her milk and burped her 

I am very grateful to have this new memory 
spending the day together in my office 

tomorrow when I go to work downtown I will miss her 
I will look at pictures of her on my phone during my lunch break 

and I will look forward to getting home at the end of the day 
to see her again TOMORROW WE ARE GOING TO WAL MART

tomorrow we are going to wal mart 
I am having trouble remembering why 

I am happy to sit here not knowing why 
but I have remembered 

we need to get some more formula for the baby 
I don't know why we are going to wal mart and not some other store

it is just what my wife said that we are going to do 
so that is fine 

I am laughing thinking about it for some reason 
how banal it can be 

she said that since it is raining 
we will go to wal mart 

it is all quite beautiful 
the thought of the impending rain and the thought of wal mart 

it is enough to sit here now
and think of it MY FINAL WILL

I would like to write another poem 
about my cat

he is sitting by the window 
watching the night

when I walked by 
he lifted his head and turned to see me 

in that moment I felt overwhelmed by 
pure love 

I went and scratched his head and he stretched out 
and yawned 

I do not know how many poems I will need to write for him 
I do not know how many is acceptable 

but without further ado 
I will now write my final will 

it is my request to whoever deals with my casket 
that I am buried with my cat 

if I die before him
please do not bury me until he has died as well so that this can be arranged 

please respect this wish 
I don’t need a funeral or a tombstone or anything 

just do whatever is necessary to assure
that we are buried together 
MORNING WALK & LUNCH BREAK

at the store today
I bought some deli turkey 

I thought that for dinner 
I would eat a sandwich with it 

but instead
we ate leftovers

tomorrow 
I will make myself a turkey sandwich 

I will put on mustard and mayo 
and lettuce 

I feel as though this sandwich 
will be my refuge 

as lunch breaks 
often are 

in this moment 
the idea of the sandwich 

already is providing me some comfort 
in how I am feeling 

I need to start waking up early again 
and going on my morning walks 

but I've found it difficult to leave
my wife and daughter

even 
for a short time

I know that it will sort itself out 
eventually 

in the meantime 
I will talk to my wife about it 

she will probably tell me 
that it is perfectly fine 

to go on a walk 
tomorrow 

of course
it is okI WANTED TO GIVE IT A SHOT

my daughter is crying in the other room 
as my wife gets her ready for bed 

the cat is sleeping in the closet 
covering his ears 

I am trying to write something down 
here 

it seems as though she is calm now 
her diaper is changed and she has had her milk 

my hands feel stained in baby shit 
my daughter is foremost a milk gremlin

when I see her 
I kiss her on the head
 
but it is of no use to her 
it is all about milk

for my cat
it is usually about food also 

for my wife
it also is 

here is my cat now 
he also wants his food

my life now 
seems to mostly be about getting food for people 

my wife had 
her cereal 

I had my turkey sandwich 
and my apple 

so it seems everyone is good 
and we can all go to bed

for the most part I am disappointed 
by what I have written here 

I knew I had nothing to say 
but I still wanted to give it a shot 

and I suppose I can't deny 
that it is the truth of what is going on 
THRASHING OUT OF THE WOMB

lately 
I am unsure what I am writing about 

after sitting with the baby 
as she cries and farts and pukes

I come to sit 
and focus

I am not entirely depleted 
but I can see how the reserve drains 

on one hand, 
I can see how my usual neurosis is less desperate to be burned 

but on the other 
I can see how the impulse has become weak 

there is a certain softness that is always lingering on my hands 
even when I am in an elevator and she is back at home 

even after I use hand sanitizer 
twice or three times it is still there 

having a baby has made me a better person 
in that I am able to see people differently 

we do not choose to be idiots 
we are simply helpless creatures 

regardless of how much thrashing we do 
and how much wisdom we look like we have 

we are born knowing everything 
and then every day we forget a little bit more 

we are born thrashing out of the womb 
and we seldom stop 

I am thrashing now as I cry and fart and puke all over myself 
I have never changed I HOPE THAT THINGS WILL BE OKAY AND THAT I WILL DIE PEACEFULLY

I hope that things will be okay 
and that I will die peacefully 

I hope that I have enough time to work on my art
until then 

I am looking forward to watching my daughter grow up
I am looking forward to being with my wife 

I don't know where we will travel
but it will be nice to be a tourist in a new place every once in a while 

I would like to sit and drink coffee 
somewhere that the weather is nicer than it is at home 

I would like to sit 
and think about some vague idea for an art project 

I would like to never make that art project
and instead eat a modest dinner with my family 

I would like to wake up early tomorrow 
and sit with my cat for fifteen minutes or so 

before I have to leave
and take the train to workMASTERPIECES ARE STUPID

masterpieces are stupid 
I would prefer to write ephemeral bullshit

that is the job I have invented for myself 
to express myself clearly 

with what I have 
today

there is no revenue 
there are no critics 

there is nowhere to go 
there is no growth

all I can do 
is honour the fact that I am not dead 

that is today's poem 
and now it is time to move on 
KICKING A CAN THROUGH THE GRASS

I am sitting and thinking about what to write 
but there is little I am thinking about 

yesterday I found myself thinking that I wanted to write shorter poems 
so I should be pleased that I don’t have much on my mind 

still I feel the need to kick the can through the grass 
because that’s what it is 

there is no point to it 
it’s just good to kick it along 

until it gets caught somewhere 
or goes off into the road 

and then the can is gone 
and you go on still thinking mostly about nothing 
FROM NOW UNTIL ETERNITY

my daughter is crying 
and my wife is trying to calm her 

I am sitting in a rocking chair across the room 
trying not to offer redundant advice 

I care about two things 
getting to spend time making art 

and 
being decent to my family 

that is what I will focus on 
from now until eternity 

I will also enjoy eating fast food 
every now and again 

for the most part 
everything else in life hasn’t done much for me 

my wife has put our daughter back into the bassinet 
she is calm now PUSH THE ROCK UP THE HILL

my mom 
and dad

have been 
in town 

we are beginning to see how my daughter 
looks like my mom

tonight we ate fried chicken 
together 

I relate to them differently 
now that I have a daughter of my own

no one knows anything 
we are all insane 

inevitably 
we cannot avoid the judgment we feel 

everything
is okay 

push the rock up the hill 
with whatever love you can muster 

and accept 
that it will never be enough

I WILL LET GOD OR WHOEVER DECIDE

at this point 
my ambition 

is to sustain my life 
for another fifty years 

I would like to write each day 
until then 

I would like to read 
some good books 

I would like to see 
how bald I become 

and 
I would like to tell some good jokes 

I would like to know my daughter 
well 

I would like my wife 
to outlive me 

I would like to make art as often as I want 
for as long as I want 

every day 
until then 

despite whatever success 
or failure that the future has in store… 

it is what it is 
I will let god or whoever decide THE GREATEST LUXURY

I am sitting in my underpants 
picking my nose 

drinking a can of sparkling water
white noise is playing in the background 

I would like to go for a long walk in the sun
I would like to sit and read in the air conditioning 

I would like my thoughts to become calm 
I would like to become excited about some passing idea 

I would like to taste a strange olive oil
I would like to fast for three days 

tonight I will sleep
and tomorrow I will drink coffee 

I will enjoy writing something down into my notebook 
and sitting as my thoughts wander aimlessly  

on one hand I have no idea who I am 
and on the other I feel completely aware of myself 

at the end of the day it is all mostly irrelevant 
which in a way is the greatest luxury I know I WAS GOING TOWARDS AIR CONDITIONING

this morning 
I wrote a poem 

I knew that it was too desperate 
to share 

I am looking at it now 
and I can see why I wanted to scrap it 

but I will share it 
regardless –– 

it seems pathetic 
more than anything

the sadness and discomfort that overwhelms the day 
when I am unable to spend time making art 

it is not about love or fun 
or any particular goal 

it is not about privilege 
or poverty 

it is not about god
or atheism 

or myself 
or anyone 

there is no end to it 
–– 

that is what I wrote 
when I was standing on the sidewalk this morning 

I was ashamed of myself
and felt a sense of conviction 

the sun was there 
between the buildings 

I was going towards
air conditioningKNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT DEAD

I would like to drink a cup of coffee 
and sit in a plaza 

I would like to write something illegible 
in a notebook 

I would like to eat a piece of fish 
and some salad

I would like to watch something on tv 
that was good 

for now 
I will sit in this chair 

imagining 
all of that 

often the thought and wanting 
means more than experience 

you forget there are bugs in the plaza
you forget writing is often meaningless 

you forget how expensive a nice dinner can be 
you forget how ephemeral even the best tv can be 

all you can do 
is sit quietly with yourself
 
and know 
that you are not dead A GOOD LESSON

I know that this poem
will not be the best 

I can tell that I am unfocused 
and that my thoughts are springing around 

but still I am sitting here 
trying to get something down 

tomorrow I think I will eat macaroni and cheese 
for lunch 

and I will sit with my daughter 
and I will see how she has learned to smile 

a bit more 
each day

I suppose that is a good lesson 
that she is teaching 

that said 
she also has learned to projectile shit

from her change table 
to the wall

and she has a new habit of suddenly waking up from a peaceful nap
hysterically screaming

so do with that 
as you will
ELBOW MUSTARD

today at the dentist 
when the needles came out 

I tried being brave
but I began to lose sight of things 

I became faint
and then I became drenched in sweat 

as things worsened 
it seemed like I was going to pass out 

I couldn't seem to calm myself down 
I thought that it might be possible that I was going to die 

I thought of my wife
and I thought about my baby daughter 

I thought of her face
and how it feels to be with her 

I felt like the thought of my daughter 
was the only thing holding me to the ground 

and then 
I settled 

and they fixed up my tooth
and sent me on my way 

I went home
and sat with her

until we went 
to costco 

we filled our cart 
with things to eat 

and after we paid I went to the bathroom and there was a guy there with the same glasses frames as me
he was washing his hands and I saw that he had mustard on his elbow

I thought that could be me 
with mustard on my elbow

but that was his day 
and I had mine 
HER MOTHER’S ARMS

tomorrow I am flying to Vancouver
for my sister’s wedding 

I am always scared 
to go on planes 

because of how high up 
they go into the sky 

it will be the first time 
I’ll spend a night away from baby Nora

I am glad she will be safe at home 
low to the ground 

sleeping
in her mother’s arms 
HOTEL ROOM

I am thinking of my wife 
and daughter 

they are sleeping 
back home 

they have 
my heart
PLANE

I thought of writing differently 
while on the plane 

I am unsure how to explain what I mean exactly 
it is just something I felt 

I will see how much of it sticks 
tomorrow 

for now I could use an aspirin 
and a glass of water 

THINKING ABOUT WHEN I WILL SEE MY FAMILY AGAIN

I was anxious about all of the family stuff that I had to do 
these past few weeks 

my parents came to meet Nora 
and then I went to Vancouver for my sister's wedding 

now I am back 
and I won't see them again for a little while 

sometimes I don't see my family for six months 
or a year at a time 

but I am lucky 
my sister might come to visit in a few weeks

and 
I will see my mom and dad again next month

we will meet them in Montreal 
for a weekend 

I'm looking forward to the drive out there
and seeing them 

I'm looking forward to them getting to see 
how Nora will have changed 
BREAKING EVERYTHING DOWN TO NOTHING

we went to costco today 
to buy a new mattress 

we had to order it for delivery 
because it wouldn’t fit in our car 

I think it will come 
next Monday 

when we were figuring out which one to buy 
I saw a mattress online that was made out of grass 

it was very thin
only about one inch tall 

I would like to try a mattress like that 
one day 

Miriam said she wouldn’t mind me getting one 
it would be good for the nights when I can’t sleep 

I could go lay on it 
in my office 

and when the baby is transitioning to her crib 
I could sleep on the ground beside her 

as I am sitting in my chair now
I am imagining lying down on a grass mattress 

as I consider it 
my back feels better already 

we have been feeling a bit depressed lately 
and I will say that somehow this seems like the answer 

perhaps things have become too soft 
and it is time 

to break everything down 
to nothing 
SELECTED POEMS

since reading too many of my own poems 
I find that my superstition has come true 

and I am finding that when I sit down to write 
I am in my own way 

I am working on selecting the best poems that I’ve written from the past few years 
and making a book 

called
selected poems 

I don’t know why the good ones seem good
and the bad ones seem bad 

but it’s obvious 
when you read them 

sometimes months pass
without writing a good one

and other times 
I’ll write a few good ones in a row 

I always knew that I was writing a lot of bullshit 
and it’s true that I was 

but I think they’ve gotten better 
for the most part 

I would imagine this one would get scrapped
but still it deserves a chance FIFTY MORE YEARS

they repaved the road outside of our house today 
we have a new mattress 

the nightlight is on in the hallway 
there are shadows on the ceiling 

I am on the surface level 
I am drinking a lime soda water

tomorrow we are planning to go to the corner grocery store 
to see if they have anything on sale 

my hope is that I don’t die 
for at least fifty more years SIT QUIETLY AND WRITE

I wonder if I will stop writing poems 
at a certain point 

I could exercise more 
I could read the news every once in a while 

I could relax and watch tv 
but instead

I am sitting here 
trying to put something together 

there isn’t much of a reason to do it
that I can come up with 

it is just what I need to do 
for nothingOUR BUS

earlier my mom sent me a photo of the reservoir near the house we lived in when I was growing up 
It is impossible to explain how that place makes me feel.  it brings me back to who I am. It is a man made body of water so there is only so much awe it can inspire 

now I am sitting on a bus 

I am anxious to get home for no reason other than to have a cold drink and see my family 

The pattern on the bus floor is speckled yellow, blue and pink

It is more interesting than you might imagine 

It is more pleasing to look at than the darkness and headlight streaks on the other side of the window 

The woman in front of me is reading a brochure of the different art classes to take in the city 

Our bus is stuck between a construction site and another bus. The other bus is somehow parked an inch away from ours. I was too busy reading over this woman’s shoulder to see how we got here. 

We have been here for fifteen minutes now, waiting for the other bus to move. Our driver could probably make it out but he doesn’t want to risk it. The situation is idiotic 

but ultimately I am quite satisfied with my life and the way things have turned out 
IF I AM STILL FEELING DEPRESSED

We took all of the apples from the fridge and cut them up and blended them and squeezed out the fibre and made juice

There was no need to add any sugar or water or anything

It reminded me of every apple I've ever ate in my life but it also tasted new 



I was feeling depressed this afternoon I think that if I understood why the feeling would vanish 

It isn't about anything in specific it is a mix of things 

I think exercise will help 



Tomorrow I will set my alarm clock early and go for a walk like I used to I will see what kind of light there is 

If I cannot find what I need there then I will drink more apple juice 

Either way I will come home and drink apple juice 



If I am still feeling depressed I will consider the apples and their imperfections 

I will think of how we cut them and blended them and squeezed out the fibre and made the juice 

And still, if I am feeling depressed –– I will ignore the feeling and move on A POCKET OF CALM

Tomorrow we are going to go to one of my favourite coffee shops to buy some beans and afterwards we are going to go for a walk in High Park 



If you don't pay attention it is easy to see the trees like stores in a shopping mall, instead I will try to find a pocket of calm 



I am trying to find a way to articulate how I am feeling –– disconnected, bored and lost...
it sounds worse than it is 



I am trying to find an angle to share some gratuity or something that I am excited about but it all feels a little faint 



I feel like if I was able to better explain it then I would be able to move past it but I'm unsure what it is



I will call it a day for now and tomorrow I will try to move slowly and focus on seeing the trees for what they are 
THE HILL

This morning when I was walking up the hill I began to feel like my old self 
it has been difficult to keep up with my exercise since the baby was born 

but I shouldn’t have lost track of it 
I can see the toll it has been taking on my mood 

When I came home after my morning walk I went down to give my cat a scratch on the head 
I felt my back seize and I have barely been able to walk all day 

If I had been taking better care of myself then I probably wouldn’t have messed up my back 
so when I am better I will get things back under control 

For me it is best to have a routine for everything 
I will start again, walking up the hill LEVELLING

For the most part I spent the day lying in bed watching videos online and writing in my journal 
It seems like this crippling back pain has dealt with the depression I was feeling the past few days 

It is possible that this is my body’s way of levelling me 
First it had tried to get me to relax with the bad mood but when that didn’t work is just cranked my back out and put me out of commission 

I’m noticing that it’s getting darker earlier now 
I’ll look forward to the fall and the winter 

I’ll get back into shape 
I will push our daughter’s stroller through the leaves and the snow 
HOW TO BECOME STRONG

When I was crossing the street today the cars had to wait as I limped across 
This injury has helped slow me down 
It has helped me away from panicking and wanting what I don't have 

I noticed some tomatoes in someone's garden 
I thought that they looked strong even though they were discoloured and mushy and they could not stand on their own and they were tied to a stick 
I looked at the tomatoes and thought, that is how to become strongTHE TUNING FORK

I am happy to sit here
on the couch

I am looking at the pot lights in the ceiling and noticing how they sprout outward into a meaningless constellation
I suppose they look like a tuning fork

I don’t know if I feel like I am looking forward to the rest of my life 
but I do have the sense that I am looking forward to tomorrow 

it seems that I am feeling a bit better 
than I have been 

I don’t really know what set me off last week 
and I don’t really know what got me out of it 

maybe there is no reason but I will say that the walk I took yesterday was good 
that will be something I will keep doing for the rest of my life 

I will look forward to seeing trees and clouds 
and sunlight 

eventually I will die and I will not see any of those things 
againSPENDING THE DAY WITH MY SISTER

Sometimes I feel like I know who I am or that I have an idea of myself
and usually that feeling is misguided 

Other days I feel desperate to know and that I am distant from myself 
and usually that feeling is also misguided 

There are other days I do not feel the need to know and I do not care to know 
today was like that 

My sister was in town
we ate at restaurants and walked along to all of the stores

I am happy that she flew out to be with us
and that she got to meet baby Nora

Often around her 
I feel like myself 
THE SHORE

the light is on in the bathroom
from where I am sitting I can see the bathmat on the ground and a bit of the soap on the countertop 

I bought a new bottle of extra strength ibuprofen gel caps from Costco today 
in a way I looked forward to taking some of them but that would require some discomfort 

my daughter and I have been working on a new secret handshake 
I will not write what it is here 

I have written three things for my enjoyment 
there is a part of me that wants to delete them 

I am thinking about the part of me that wants to delete them 
I am not sure if that part of me is driving the ship or watching us fade off into the horizon 

but there they are 
I can't tell whether or not they are waving or holding up their middle finger 

there
they are getting smaller as we get further away from the shore 
I DO NOT WANT TO LOSE SIGHT OF EASE

I have always found it difficult to write 
I don't think that I'm very good at it 

I don't say that to be self depreciating 
but I think that it is an impossible thing to be good at 

it is a difficult thing to measure 
by anyone's standard 

it seems like being a dad is similar 
it is difficult 

it isn't easy to be a part of a family 
and it isn't easy to be alone 

tomorrow I will wake up 
and begin again 

I think that there is a way to know that things will be difficult 
and they should be treated with ease 

I do not want to lose sight 
of ease 
SLOW MOVING

when I was walking to the subway today I saw a guy wearing a blue shirt 
he was standing near a door, opening it with a key 

I don’t know why it stood out to me 
it might have been the way the color of the blue on his shirt looked near the color of the sign behind him 

the sign was also blue, but a different kind of blue 
I think it was teal 

he walked through the door and went nowhere 
never to be seen again 

afterward I used the hand sanitizer from the automatic dispenser 
and then I waved the thing that made the door open for me 
THE HYPOTHETICAL WHEEL

earlier today, when I was writing in my journal 
I had the feeling that it was pointless

that pointlessness used to inspire me 
but now it feels different 

it feels like I can't focus properly 
or at least I can't focus on it enough to make the process worth the while –– to make it meaningful 

I feel like I want to say that the wheel is moving too quickly 
and it is impossible to catch up to 

I don't know what type of wheel it is 
it's just a hypothetical wheel 

it's wooden and old and the sun blares downward onto it
the grass is dead beneath it

people come to look at it 
they don't know why they are interested in it but they are 

a lot of people take pictures of the wheel 
some even take videos of it on their phones 

it is isn't very often that they look back at the photos or the videos 
or send them to anyone 

but for some reason they all just had the urge to capture it 
when they were there 
ENDING

I wanted to write something 
about writing the ending of a poem 

I will say that I've realized there isn't a need to resolve or to say anything 
like I thought there was

it is good to end on a confused note
or a curious note or anything 

the point often is to take the time to say something that cannot be said 
ordinarily 

what else would be the point of writing in this form
if not to allow idiocy and incoherence 

there is no story or point or anything 
and at any moment, for no apparent reason at all, you can just end BEING THERE

I have to brush my teeth 
soon 

and then I have to close my eyes 
and go to sleep 

and then I have to have 
a dream 

and then 
I will wake up 

and I will give my cat some breakfast
and I will make my coffee

the day will be new 
and I will try to be there 

some days I am there 
and other days I am not 

some days I am able to get there
and other days I am unable 

I cannot expect that every day 
I will be there 
STATE OF THE UNION

I have been having a hard time focusing 
and taking care of myself 

I don't know what it is 
perhaps I have been drinking too much coffee

this might be how a lot of people feel 
as new parents 

I have only been a dad 
for two months 

it seems difficult 
to get my feet into the ground WITH OUR PICTURES

I was looking at a book I got from the library
it is about a painter

most all of the paintings he made seemed simple enough
he showed things the way he wanted to

his paintings have a way of tricking you into seeming realistic
but if you stay with them you realize they aren’t at all

they are of things like
gas stations, bridges and people in rooms

what I like most about his pictures is that they don’t panic when you aren’t paying attention to them
they aren’t desperate like we are with our picturesTHE WORST ARTIST IN CANADA

I am sitting at the table eating slices of cheese 
I am anxious as usual 

less anxious than I was this morning 
but still anxious 

when I use the word anxious
what I mean is thinking about the future and obsessing about how things are going to go wrong 

it is a compulsive thing 
it is like my brain gets addicted to it 

worst case scenario I lose my job 
worst case scenario I am the worst artist in Canada 

I am laughing while I think of myself as unemployed 
and the worst artist in Canada 

it isn’t so bad 
imagining myself as I’ve been many times before — 

unemployed and
the worst artist in Canada 
MORNING PARKING LOT OUTSIDE THE PHYSIOTHERAPIST'S OFFICE

this morning 
I was a bit early for my physiotherapist appointment 

I went to the other end of the strip mall 
and got a coffee at tim hortons 

and I drank it 
in my car 

after a few minutes I drove back to the other end of the parking lot
and parked in front of the physiotherapist's office 

I sat and drank more of my coffee
and enjoyed being in the parking lot in the morning SATURDAYS

it is difficult to enjoy
Saturdays

I try to relax 
but I just get anxious 

tomorrow 
is Saturday 

I will try not to watch too many videos on my phone
I will try to walk as much as possible 

I will try not to drink too much coffee
I will try to cook 

I will try to have fun doing something that isn't making something or writing something down 
I will try to take a nap or sit quietly and read a book 

I will talk to you again on Sunday 
and I will let you know how it goes
IT IS ALL ECONOMICS

I resent having to deal with getting 
haircuts 

sometimes I cut all my hair off
and other times I never cut my hair 

imagine all the time you have lost
to your hair 

imagine all the time you have lost 
facing indecision 

imagine all the time that is in the forest 
where there is no wind 

and meanwhile you are sitting around 
worrying about your haircut

it happens to all of us 
every now and again 

perhaps I should have a buzz cut again 
perhaps then... things would be resolved

and perhaps I should begin eating cat food 
and sleeping on the ground 

it is all economics 
at the end of the day 
TODAY

I have been doing a bit better at chess lately 
for a while I was getting my ass kicked left right and centre 

otherwise I feel like I didn't have the most successful day 
even though I was working since early in the morning, I feel like I haven't gotten anything done 

it is like I am getting my ass kicked 
left right and centre 

I am attached to the result 
and the process 

I find it difficult to envision my success in the future 
I feel like I am where I have and always will be EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW

I spent some good time with Nora today 
a lot of it is just us looking at one another 

I feel like she is very understanding
she proves that two months on earth is all you need 

to know everything 
that there is to know 

I think that it's true that we know everything when we're born 
and then 

each day 
we forget and forget 

until 
we become totally lost 

when I was holding her today I realized that she will look to me 
when she is lost 

I will hope to do my best to guide her 
and 

I will try to find a way to teach her that she already knows everything 
there is to know THE GROCERY STORE

tomorrow I will meet my friend
at the movie theatre 

I feel a bit bad about spending the money 
I know that I will be making less in the next few months 

still we will have enough to get by 
but it can be difficult not to worry 

it is a lot of vague 
what if'ing 

none of it is rooted in any logic
it is just flailing aimlessly 

I hope that there are still apples and steaks at the store 
I hope that the electrical outlets in our house keep powering our stuff 

even if I have to get another job 
it will be okay 

I suppose no matter how bad things get 
I just hope that there is always food in the grocery store

everything else 
can probably be sorted out as it comes A NEW WAY TO MAKE MONEY

I have realized that
I’m making too much money 

doing something
that I don’t truly believe in 

I feel fraudulent 
and that I am selling out

I want to teach my daughter to trust herself 
to trust her intuition 

to not go down the path that she knows is fraudulent 
to not go down the path that she knows she is selling herself out for 

I cannot teach her that 
unless I lead the way 

so I will take the risk 
and I will follow my intuition 

I will go 
in a new direction 

and I will find a new way 
to make money DAUGHTER

after dinner tonight 
we are thinking of going to the ice cream place near our house 

they have a special cucumber ice cream 
that we are hoping to try 

there is always a long lineup there
it is well deserved 

it costs six dollars for one ice cream 
so we share it between the two of us 

one day our baby daughter will be able to try the ice cream there 
I’m looking forward to seeing her enjoy a treat like that 

she has begun crying now
having woken up from her nap HOW TO BE A GREAT ARTIST

trying to make money off of art is absurd 
it will lead you nowhere 

make art that you have no way of explaining 
make art that makes you feel embarrassed

do your best not to ask anyone what they think of your art 
their opinions are not helpful 

go to the library and find a book made by an artist that you like
think of how little that book cares what you think 

finish what you're working on as fast as possible 
don't look back at what you've made 

never have any ideas in advance 
if you do, then there is no point of acting on them

accept that you are the worst artist 
in the history of the world 

and then 
see what happensOUR WALK

today we went for a walk just the two of us  
I pushed you in your stroller while you looked up at the clouds 

I took a picture of the clouds you looked at 
I don't know if you will remember them otherwise 

you wore a pink cardigan that our friend knit for you 
and it matched the blanket that your yaya knit for you 

we walked through the park and up the hill 
and past the little library and back home TRYING TO CAPTURE THE SUN

eventually it becomes time 
to let go of the things that are not serving you 

today when I was walking with my baby daughter  
I saw that the sun was a certain way 

I tried to capture it with my camera 
but I couldn't get it the way I wanted 

when you notice something like that 
it is best to let it go 

when you have an idea for something 
it is best to let it go 

know that when a mosquito lands on your neck 
you will slap it without thinking 

that is what happened to me this evening 
when I was fiddling with my camera 

trying to capture the sun 
on our walk I KNEW IT WOULDN'T

tomorrow 
I will look forward to spending some time 

sitting and 
writing 

first thing 
in the morning 

there is something about writing 
first thing 

that beats 
any other time of day 

especially 
when everyone else is sleeping 

I don't think writing will get me anywhere 
I think that I always knew that

I tried to convince myself 
to believe that it would 

but I knew 
it wouldn't 

still
I kept doing it 

for some other reason
that I don't fully understand 

no one is really that good at writing 
even the people who are best at it 

today when I was waiting for the subway to arrive I was thinking about all of the dread and discomfort and insecurity I've pointlessly endured 
when I was walking later on I noticed that a plane was flying strangely low to the ground 

for some reason they both stuck in my mind and I wanted to note them down later 
I have done that now 

you can see how pointless the impulse to write things down can be 
but it is there 

you can try to redirect it 
or fight it or understand it 

but there is no point 
just let it be what it is and try not to think about it too much WE WERE WALKING WITH MOM

tonight 
Nora and I 

went to the library 
to return some books 

I noticed how the light crossed over her 
when we passed underneath the streetlights

in the day time the clouds passed over 
similarly 
 
at some points the sun would pass through the trees
similarly 

we were walking with mom 
in the day time 

we went to the dollar store
and the library 

I can't imagine a better 
day LUNCH BREAK

today I ate my sandwich 
on the bench I usually sit at

there was bird shit on 
it 

I put on my hat 
because the sun was burning my head 

I looked at some pictures of 
my daughter 

I missed her 
and looked forward to being home with her 

it seems like love is a thing that doesn't run out
instead it has a way of growing

I don't mean to be sentimental 
it is just how it seems to be 
FIND A WAY TO BE PRESENT

last night I had a dream that I was driving a car 
when I woke up my cat was sleeping at my feet 

tonight we ate mcdonalds 
it is good to eat there every once in a while 

it is good to lower your expectation 
as much as possible 

instead 
find a way to be present 

whether you have mistaken your cat for a gas pedal 
in a dream 

or you are eating french fries 
and diet coke 

with 
your family BULLET POINTS

sometimes 
I think of simply reiterating 

what happened 
or what I think is going to happen 

what ought to happen 
what is bound to happen 

instead 
it is better to talk about something else 

something that you don't know 
about 

some random thing 
that doesn't even make that much sense 

something 
to pick the scab on your head about

maybe by talking it over 
it will make sense 

maybe by sitting with the thing 
dismantling it and trying to build it back up 

there is some information there 
that is more useful

than thinking about what happened 
in bullet points 
ON BEING A DAD

I am sitting here 
waiting for the water to cool 

before I add in the formula 
milk mix 

six scoops 
to twelve ounces 

usually Miriam does 
everything 

but more and more 
I am helping 

I don’t want to be the best dad in the world 
but I want to be a good dad to our Nora

I really don’t know much about being a dad 
it’s only been three months 

I will go mix the milk now 
and bring it upstairs 
MY CAT

we are going to drive to Montreal 
tomorrow 

all day 
I have been thinking about my cat 

and how we won't be able to see him 
for three nights 

I know he will be taken care of 
but I worry about him 

I will look forward to coming home on Sunday 
to see him HOTEL ROOM

I didn’t realize how simple it is to get to Montreal 
from our house 

it is a straight shot along the highway 
for five hours 

we are in the hotel room 
lying in a bed that is bigger than the one we have at home 

I am thinking of our cat and wishing I was closer to him 
I wish there was a way for him to know that 

Nora is very congested 
we are trying to help her clear her nose with steam from the shower 

still 
she seems in good spirits 

I hope she will sleep well through the night 
and feel better in the morning THINKING OF MY CAT AT HOME

I am lying in the hotel bed
thinking of my cat at home 

for some reason I am thinking of his claws 
and how sometimes they dig into my arm when I am carrying him around 

I don’t know what it is that makes me miss him
it is beyond logic and reason 

it is more important than
those things 

it is impossible 
to explain ON THE STREET IN MONTREAL

I haven't been doing the best writing lately 
I have been on vacation 

staying in an expensive hotel 
eating and gawking at storefronts 

spending quality time with family 
watching reality tv 

I'm happy that my parents got to spend some good time with my daughter 
I am happy we got to sit outside and eat smoked meat sandwiches together 

I am imagining myself 
thirty years from now

I don't think I will forget that memory 
of us eating smoked meat sandwiches together 

on the street 
in montreal IT IS GOOD TO BE A HOBBYIST

I haven't been doing the best writing
lately 

which feels
disgraceful, somewhat 

I read a poem that I liked today 
in synagogue 

in the margin 
of the siddur 

it is by Merle Feld
it is called Though I Stared Earnestly at my Fingernail 

I thought in a way 
it was like a poem I would write 

it must be a strange feeling
to be published in a siddur 

I would imagine that would be a greater honour 
than I would want 

instead 
my ambition will remain in the ether 

tethered to some procrastination 
and neurosis 

I hope it does not sound self loathing 
or self pitying to say –– 

it is good 
to be a hobbyist 
BE IN THE DIRT

one thing about making art 
is that you have to go through times 

when you feel like a failure 
sometimes it lasts for an afternoon 

other times 
longer 

it seems like that is just part 
of digging towards whatever it is we are digging towards 

the only thing to do 
is to work through it 

until 
you find yourself at some reasonable conclusion 

I think that we make art 
to go through the dirt 

to see what there is 
past where we went before 

sometimes it makes us feel connected to some kind of meaning 
and other times it makes us feel disconnected from everything 

know 
that there is no avoiding it 

know
that no matter what tools you find 

or praise you get 
you will still be in the dirt THE ERA OF THE VIDEO CAMERA

I sometimes wonder 
about all of the writers 

who weren't around 
in the era of the video camera

I wonder how many of them 
would make the choice to make movies 

instead of writing 
books or poems 

it is hard to make sense 
of the difference 

usually I think that writers 
are better artists than filmmakers 

and that filmmakers are better artists 
than musicians

I have been sitting here thinking about it 
I spend a lot of time doing all three of those things 

and really 
what I think I'm saying 

is that making music is the most enjoyable, 
making movies is the second most enjoyable

and writing
is the least enjoyable

therefor 
writing sits on the top shelf 

it is nonsense 
but I just wanted to sort it out for my own sake 

my own sake 
of becoming a great artist 

that has always been my dream 
I suppose I will leave it at that HOW TO BE SINCERE

when I first started writing these poems 
I would write about squids and dirt and people that didn't exist 

I craved freedom from sense 
and intelligence 

I don't seem to have the need to write that way anymore
I tried all kinds of things these past few years of writing one poem per day 

it seems like sincerity has more mileage 
than anything else 

I don't know if posing the question -- how to be sincere -- is useful 
it isn't difficult 

it is a good way to sign a letter 
but we don't write letters like that very often at all, if ever

so I hope during this time 
of writing these poems 

if nothing else
I have learned to be 

sincere 
enough 
REFLECTING ON THE DAY

I enjoyed listening to the radio while on the subway today 
I enjoyed talking to my mom on the phone 

I enjoyed feeding a bottle of milk to my daughter 
I enjoyed a shabbat dinner with family 

sometimes it takes effort to notice what is good
and other times it is easy 

I am noticing that for some reason 
today, it was easy 

I don’t know if there is any rhyme or reason to it 
it just happened to be that way 

some days work out 
and others are a little tougher to get through 

but it is good to have a good one
when you can I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE THERE

I enjoyed walking through the woods 
today 

looking at the way the leaves were
looking at the way the sun was 

I was alone 
for the most part 

some woman asked me 
if I was looking at a bird

I told her I was just looking 
at the leaves

she seemed disinterested 
and walked away with her dog 

eventually I bumped into her again 
the dog barked at me and then licked my hand 

she told him to get down 
but he didn't listen to her 

somehow 
seeing her 

cheapened 
things 

until 
I was alone again 

a better writer would know why 
but I'm not really sure 

I walked farther away from the path after that 
where there were a lot of little bugs 

I didn't see anyone 
thereIT IS DIFFICULT TO DO

I'm often unsure 
as to what it means to take care of other people 

it may be from a lack of empathy on my behalf 
it may be because I am narcissistic 
 
it may be 
from a lack of knowing what to do 

it is difficult
and maybe that's why it is more important than anything

I haven't been a dad
for very long 

I am trying to learn 
how to take care of my family

I am trying to learn 
how to take care of myself 

there is no clear answer 
but 

I think it's probably best to start with food 
make sure the meals are under control 

and 
try to be reasonable about sleep 

let people tell you the truth 
and tell the truth 

focus
and don't ignore your intuition 

all of that said
I will admit 

I have a headache 
and I'm exhausted

I know I should stop and go downstairs and get to bed
but it is difficult to do 
VECTORS

I am unsure how to explain how I am feeling in this moment 
it is a mix of anxiousness 

and 
insecurity 

I don't think it is towards anything 
in specific 

it is just
a baseline feeling 

it seems that in a way 
I have lost sight of my vectors 

that my ability to ground myself 
has been eaten by the internet 

I think this is why I am looking forward to returning to synagogue 
on the weekend 

it does not seem corrupt 
thereMY HIGHEST AMBITIONS

tomorrow 
I would like to go somewhere 

with my camera
and film some stuff 

when I was driving today 
I saw an area that I wanted to go to 

there is a big construction site
and car washes 

and old buildings 
I thought that I would enjoy going around there 

if I can't go tomorrow
maybe I will have the chance to go 

on Friday 
afternoon 

I also need to clean up the house 
I am trying to get better at that 

I know it might not seem like much 
but at the moment 

these are my highest 
ambitions 

I want to do them carefully 
and meaningfully 

because lately 
I have been a bit more absent 

than 
I would like

to 
admit 
UNREMARKABLE FOR THE MOST PART

today 
I had the chance to go and film 

where I said 
I was going to 

it was unremarkable for the most part 
I saw birds on cranes, worn out signs, things like that 

I parked at the grocery store
and I'm glad I didn't get a ticket

I didn't think I would
even though all the signs said that I would 

I would like to go back to that area again 
maybe next time a bit more west 

I was trying to remember 
what this city was like

when I first moved here 
all of those years ago 

I can remember it was overwhelming at times 
but now a lot of it feels meaningless 

but maybe 
if I take the footage I shot and set it up just right 

I can fabricate some meaning
that will suffice GLASS OF WATER

I am sitting 
and drinking water

and looking at the light on the wall 
and some shadow from my chair 

I have been trying to keep focus 
of a good future

it is easy to become distracted 
by the lure of failure 

and the comfort 
of staying where we are 

I am sitting 
and drinking water 

the light and the shadow have gone 
a cloud has covered them 

I am sitting with my thoughts 
drinking my water

and now
I will go refill my glass in the sink 

I would offer you a glass 
as well 

I can get it for you 
while I'm up 
IT IS A BIT LIKE THE EARTH IS TAKING A NAP

we had a nap 
this afternoon 

after our walk 
in the leaves

it was as cold as its been 
since you've been born 

I had a dream 
that I heard you speak 

in some years 
from now 

you were probably four 
or six years old 

I don't know what you said 
but I could hear you were confident 

it will get a bit colder each day 
for the next while 

but you will see 
that it brings a certain peace to the air 

it is a bit like the earth is taking a nap 
we can imagine 

it is having a dream 
about somethingDEFEAT

there is something about making art
the process defeats you 

what I am working on now 
seems like an utter failure 

it looks like there is no way 
to make it work 

but still, somehow it is impossible to overcome the compulsion 
to continue picking the scab 

to continue 
exhausting the dirt 

and eventually 
through volition 

or something like that 
it will sort itself out THE THING

it seems
like

I have sorted out the thing 
I was working on 

for most of the day 
I thought it was unsalvageable trash 

but I was able to keep with it 
and now somehow 

I am beginning to have the feeling 
that it is good 

and in a way 
it is better than the other things I have made

I am always happy to have that feeling 
I suppose that is as good of a goal as any 

I still have a bit of work to do on it 
but I think I will be able to stick the landing 

perhaps the message
is clear 

do what you can 
to defeat yourself 

and then 
be relentless 

until 
you finish the thing 
ODE TO MY CAMERA

I am looking forward 
to going around 

with my camera
tomorrow 

all of this messing around with cameras 
these past few months... 

I've really enjoyed it 
a lot 

I would recommend getting a camera 
that you are happy with 

to take around 
with you 

you will notice 
the reflection in a doorknob

you will notice 
a strange passing cloud 

you will notice
that there are a lot of different ways

of looking 
at the world SYNAGOGUE

I have been sitting here 
for a while 

almost an hour 
not writing anything 

I am thinking 
about being in synagogue last weekend 

it meant something to have my daughter there 
drinking her bottle, sleeping 
FROM THE WAL MART TO THE GROCERY STORE

when we were walking from the wal mart 
to the grocery store 

I wondered who could tell
that we were jews 

I imagined how little all of this meant to some
how oblivious some of them probably were

I found myself looking at the skin of the man who worked the till 
trying to guess his nationality 

and his faith 
he was kind and went about bagging our cauliflower thoughtfully 

on the way back to the car I noticed a Canadian flag outside the wal mart 
I wasn't sure what to make of it ––

I saw the direction of the wind 
the direction of the fear that has been blown across the world 

I don't know if I am meant to pretend I am brave 
instead, I will focus on perseverance 

and trying to imagine 
reconciliation 

despite how impossible 
it seemsSOUP NEWS

I am going to make some soup tomorrow 
from lentils and cauliflower 

and chicken stock 
and onion 

otherwise
I am unsure how I feel 

I have been keeping a close eye 
on the news 

it is not as simple
as lentils and cauliflower 

and chicken stock
and onion

when we were in synagogue last 
the rabbi asked what good praying does 

he said that it isn't always clear 
he said it cannot fix a bridge but maybe it can mend our spirit

I am unsure what praying means 
in my life 

in a way 
it seems 

like making soup and reading the news 
is about as close as I get I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A CAMERA ONE DAY

we went for a walk this afternoon 
walking along where we usually do 

I took blurry pictures of plants 
while you slept 

they were just there on people's lawns 
waiting under the sun 

they are plants I have walked by 
many times 

but somehow, at the right angle, they become more than weeds and grass 
they become more than something someone bought at home depot

I am happy we have this time together 
to walk and aimlessly take pictures 

I would like to give you a camera 
one day 

you can have mine
if you would like FAITH

my default state 
often 

is that things will end in failure 
and disappointment 

it has taken me my entire life 
to understand 

that it takes a work 
to imagine a better future 

for myself
and for others 

when you cannot imagine a favourable outcome 
you have to think harder 

it's a discipline 
more than anything

I am beginning to understand that maybe that is what faith is 
maybe it doesn't need to be any more complicated than that DOUBT

I spent most of the day 
reading the news 

thinking about 
everything that has been going on 

it is impossible to know
how it will resolve

I will continue to try to imagine 
a better life for all 

while I do this 
I can sense my doubt 

as I consider that doubt 
I can see that it is my weakness 

it is unambitious 
it is moldA WAY TO ORDER THE WORLD

it was good to walk 
outside today 

I went out 
to go take pictures 

I have begun to notice
that there is a momentum to it 

if you are too precious 
and busy yourself with trying to find something good 

you won't shoot
anything

but if you just film something 
any stupid thing –– 

you will begin 
and you will film something else 

and then you are walking 
and shooting 

there are few things that I find as fun
as that

it was a good break
from studying the news 

it was a way to order the world 
in my own way 
EVERYONE TRYING TO FIND THEIR WAY

we were at costco today 
there were all kinds of people there 

many different races 
people from all over the world

everyone was looking to fill their carts
they were looking for a good price or to try something new 

usually I am trying to force my cart through 
all of the obscene traffic

but today 
I was happy to be there, among people 

everyone 
trying to find their way TRYING TO SORT OUT SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE BULLSHIT

I will look forward
to waking up tomorrow 

to drinking my coffee
and looking out the window 

the anxiety will take its hold 
as usual

I will go onto my computer 
and begin editing the video that I took last week 

I will have no idea what I'm doing
I will click the mouse and push buttons on the keyboard

I will stare at the screen 
and try to form something that aligns with my intuition 

eventually, after a few days –– I will find some way of ordering it all 
and I will ride the high of that 

and then, as usual –– I will crash and burn 
and sleep 

and then I will wake up 
and have my coffee 

and continue writing 
and editing 

and trying to sort out something 
that doesn't feel like bullshitNO RESOLUTION

I have no capacity to understand the reality of the danger that people are in 
on the other side of the world 

it won't be over tomorrow 
or in a week from now 

it seems that there is no foreseeable end to it 
it could go on for years to come 

I have been sitting here for an hour 
writing sentences 

and then 
deleting them I LOVE ART MORE THAN YOU LOVE DEATH

I have been trying to write a poem all day 
writing about how useless it feels to make art 

the truth is that I often get to thinking 
that for the most part –– art is bullshit 

but the more I sat
and the more I wrote

the more I realized that the idea was riddled in fallacy 
I realized 

that I love art 
more than you love death PERMANENCE

soon I will have written one thousand 
of these posts

my plan is to stop 
there

I am grateful to have found a way 
to write all of this 

it has taught me to know myself 
a bit better 

I wish that I could know myself 
permanently 

but I don't know if that's possible 
I wish that I could write permanently 

but I don't know if that's possible 
either PARENTING 101

I had some time today 
to go for a walk 

Nora slept 
and I took pictures of the leaves 

they are more orange now 
less red for the most part 

we had to get home to make dinner 
but I felt like we could have walked for a long time 

if it is not raining 
we will go for a long walk tomorrow

even though 
we have been up and down every street 

so many 
times

we will keep looking 
and find more pictures to take 
THE CANADIAN

I spent hours walking today 
listening to people talk about Israel and Gaza 

at some point I felt a drop of rain on my head
and I felt a surge of panic 

a rain drop 
a single rain drop 
NATURAL CAUSES

our laundry machine is broken
I washed Nora's clothes in the bathtub with some soap 

she is sleeping now 
there is white noise coming from the baby monitor 

our cat is drinking water from his bowl 
he is looking upward 

there are leftovers in the fridge 
we will watch tv before bed 

we will be lucky to one day die 
from more or less –– natural causes IN A WAY, AWAY FROM THE WORLD

I wonder what it would be like 
to move to Vancouver Island 

to grow some vegetables 
to own a firearm or two 

to be surrounded by the ocean 
to be –– in a way, away from the world 

it is unrealistic 
but 

it is nice to think about 
what it would be like IDIOCY AND TRANSCENDENT JOY

I used to write such simple and idiotic things 
here

it seems like that is no longer an option 
it seems like I am trying to get to something else

I was reading my daughter her book tonight
before bed...

it was about a hippo 
who was lonely 

he hosts a massive party 
but

in the end 
he was still lonely 

it reminded me of the kind of thing I used to write 
here

there was something about the story 
that had some kind of transcendent joy 

that could only be reached
with idiocy 

I will try to remember that 
–– CUTTING A POTATO IN HALF

today
as I was walking up the stairs 

I thought of writing about cutting a potato 
in half 

I spent most of the day reading about the Abraham accords 
and cynism 

but there was something about cutting that potato in half 
that occurred to me 

as 
something to write about 

it's true that the potatoes turned out well 
but –– 

well... 
maybe we are not as complicated as we would like to think that we areTO RETURN HOME

I walked for a long time today 
looking at buildings and trees 

listening to the news in my headphones 
there are a lot of ways the world could end 

I stopped and sat and drank a cup of coffee 
I wrote messages to my wife 

she sent me a photo 
of her and our daughter 

I drank my coffee quickly 
to return home 
THE MEANING OF LIFE

I have finished my glass of diet coke 
and am sitting beside the fireplace

the fire isn't on 
I know that I have nothing to say 

I have been enjoying listening to music 
this afternoon 

somehow 
these past years 

it seems like listening to music 
became something to augment a dull experience

always take time to listen to music that you love 
I could make the argument that that is the meaning of life

not the empty glass of diet coke
or the fireplace that isn't even on COLLECT SCRAPS OF HOPE

as I listen to the news
I try to collect what scraps of hope I can find ––

I found some solace reading the Abraham accords
they describe what peace could look like

I found myself learning about cynicism
in order to recognize it in myself, to overcome it

I am trying to collect these scraps of hope
for my daughter

to lay some kind of foundation 
that is strong enough to support the optimism I see in her

to find an angle
to show her

that we do not need to move towards
an empty future
NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINTH POEM

something I can promise 
to anyone 

is
that

writing 
is difficult 

when you sit to write 
and you feel that your gut has been vacuumed into a black hole 

think back and remember
that difficulty 

has always been your loyal 
ally 

know 
the virtue

of pushing the boulder 
up the hill 

notice how trite the joy is 
for that moment the boulder balances at the top of the hill

and notice –– as you 
watch it roll downward 

even for the nine hundred and ninety ninth 
time

that the reward 
was between 

you 
and your gut 

and the vacuum 
and the black hole
