the martyr<br> 
from a nap.  out into the yard… 
<p>
in a tree socket,
presumably <br>this was self inflicted… a courageous sacrifice 
</p>
<p>a reconciled purpose<br> without a price. <br>on a three hour walk
decided to share a slurpee from seven eleven
and eat dinner at home
</p>

the trees have begun 
<br>
the dogs and the trash cans themselves

I can see now what is happening 

<br>the dust, the shelf at the electronics store 
<br>

what seemed like a sudden gust of wind 
was more than a proverbial sweep of the broom 
<p>

I will try to be patient as this passes 

but I must admit –– I have begun to feel slightly anxious 
</p>
<p>
There is still dirt behind my ear 
from  a bucket of kimchi in the ground
<br>
I was so nervous about leaving the kimchi behind that I ate my fingernail off.
It shed onto the ground like snakeskin. 
 
I would have dug the kimchi back out and perhaps even eaten all of it in one sitting.


So in a way I am glad 
…the longer I am here, the better the kimchi will taste when I return. 
</p>
<p>


The small plastic garbage can
waits patiently 
in the corner of the room 
while the light breaks off the wall 
but eventually
the time will come 
when it too 
must throw itself
away.

the list goes on…………………………………………………………..

I eat chips and watch many shows on tv, one after another.

The list goes on...

asphalt 
<br> some people say that the luxury ones  look the best
while other people prefer a more colloquial feeling

<p>a house for sale a few blocks away  –– not only the roof but also on the stairs leading up to the front door…

the house was quite small 
and any choice may be suitable at the end of the day
<br>
I am wondering how to make some money next week perhaps a box of computer keyboards fell off the back of the truck into the loading dock and into the sewer they went down through the muck until they arrived 
<p>
I saw an air purifier, 
it was hard to tell if it was broken or not… 
but maybe someone would find it useful one day
–– I climbed down to get it
<br>
when I was down there I had a moment of self reflection –– a wave of gratitude came over me,

it’s hard to explain why it seemed so deeply meaningful and if I'm being honest, I will admit that I became quite emotional  
<br>
I’ve been very lucky to have this air purifier… 
<br>who would have guessed that I would have been the one who needed it in the end
<br>
next time I hope to pay better attention and not out into my feelings like that 

<p>
watching the hanging of F<br>
The general consensus seemed to be in favour of his execution... but there were still a handful of protestors there. 

I didn't join them but I do believe that given the right circumstance, Friedrich could have changed his behaviour eventually. 
<br>

before Friedrich died I watched him whisper something to the executioner. 

I mostly forgot about all of this 

<p>
I was sitting at my desk thinking things over 
<br>
I ended up watching a tutorial online about cleaning up glass.

The person in the video showed a basic dustpan and broom method.

It seemed like a good enough idea, 

I'm on my way back now to clean up the glass. 
</p>

my detriment 

I wish I'd figured this out earlier. Imagine all that I could have accomplished... 

<p>
photo of clouds<br> 

upset that her photo of clouds had to find some sense of solace. 
<br>
It seemed clear to her that they all believed that the photo was unique and breathtaking <br>despite their lack of public enthusiasm 

they all tried to console her in saying that the photo's popularity was trivial if it represented something more deeply meaningful to her on a personal level... if it was in fact an authentic reflection of her and a true expression of her inner being then what did its popularity matter at the end of the day?
<br>
The identical nature of their response seemed peculiar <br>

she began to feel an overwhelming sense that they may be, in fact, conspiring against her. 

In trying to repress her doubt Linda began to view her friends as cruelly and idiotically stunted in their mental capacities. 


Linda, her egregiously narcissistic tendencies had gotten the best of her... 
<br>
...but if you saw the photo that Linda took you would agree that it was terrible. 
<br>she was delusional in her ability to capture the beauty she claimed. 

you would think that I would find a way to tell her that her photography skills are nothing short of abysmal but the truth is I just don't have the heart. 

I'm unsure how to continue with this client. I do sincerely enjoy our Wednesday afternoon chats and she does seem perfectly comfortable in paying my rate indefinitely but...  I think she would find peace if someone just worked up the courage to tell her the truth about her cloud photo.   

In the meantime, as I figure this out, I've decided to start her on trial dose of C. I haven't had much success prescribing it in the past but hopefully third time's a charm. Fingers crossed.

there are so many great shows on all the time. 

but I know I will become too tired to stay awake that late at night. 
<br>
Last night I was up between 3:30 and 6:30 so today I am very tired, but with a few cups of coffee I am doing alright. 
</p>


<p>
I was considering writing a story about a bar of soap 
The other characters in the movie would be an empty water bottle that had been run over by a car and was in the gutter.
</p>
<p>The tuna salad has been selling extremely well this week, a lot more than usual and I have no idea why.
I'll be honest, I've been daydreaming a lot about what I'm going to do with the extra cash.
<br>
I am thinking of buying a gift  and decided I would try to find a good plant. 
<br>
There was one store I knew of that wasn't too far away. I looked through the window and it seemed to have many different types that were decently priced, but unfortunately they were closed <br>

I knew there was another shop a couple blocks away. I was lucky to get the time to walk 
<br>
The second plant store was expensive. I wasn't even feeling that cheap, I just thought everything was over priced so I took off. 
<br>
And then the third shop, was on the way back to my house. 

I found a small plant outside. It was the only one left <br>

They charged .50 cents extra for debit <br> And  they charged 1.00 extra to use credit. They were lucky I didn't walk out after seeing that. 

</p>
<p>
I ended up making a decent wage today<br>
carrying tables, pylons
and listening closely to the radio, finding out what needs to be done. 

I will look forward to waking up tomorrow, 
with a clear mind, 
to return to work on my stories again.

And in a month or so, when my cheque comes 
in the mail 
I will cash it immediately. 
</p>


I am afflicted sometimes 
by a certain mood, that by way of subtle indirect tension, inflicts a sort of spiritual paralysis.
<br>
Suddenly the future becomes futile, bleak<br>
the present intolerable 
and the past frames itself as a vague history of failed attempts to avoid the inevitable. 

Forced optimism as a strategy to mitigate, seems like the obvious fix 
but unfortunately only grinds against the stone
strengthening its hold and prolonging its symptoms.
<br>
Instead sometimes it can be best to succumb to it.

Find a way to let it be <br>
so it can dissipate. <br>
it may be that the antidote to the condition is to acknowledge and accept it. 
<br>
As I come up for air now, and my ability to string words together returns, 
I hope that taking these notes will allow me to better recognize it in the future.
So that when this happens again, the cortisol will remain at bay. 

And in the meantime 
I will continue to write, as a means of plunging through the belly of the beast. 
</p>
<p>

a note to plant owners 

Someone left a leaf
inside of a jar 
by the window

and it has now grown exponentially.

So much so
that it has destroyed 

the jar

and the room

and the house 

and the country 

and the earth 

and the sun 

and the moon 

and the universe.

And now everything is lettuce. 

Please, for next time -- take good care of your plants
but not to the extent that they incite the demise of all conceivable matter and beyond.

Drinking chocolate milk 
for the first time in years... 

I have returned to when I was just tall enough to reach the refrigerator door 
as a young man.

I would push a chair across the kitchen,
ascend to the top shelf, and carry the carton down. 

I was fearless then.

With sheer willpower alone I could lift trucks from the sidewalk,
create masterpieces, and land on my feet. 

But one day something happens

and we needed someone to take responsibility 
for our failures...

it takes a minute, or two, to realize that the biggest failure of all 
is to neglect that the responsibility is ours alone. 

There is a wormhole there, in the sole proprietorship of failure
that allows us to get back to the place 

where sheer willpower alone can lift trucks from the sidewalk,
create masterpieces, and land on our feet. 

So what would I tell that young man now,
if I had the chance?

Push the chair across the kitchen and 
always reach for the chocolate milk.
</p>
<p>

Sometimes I get nothing done,

I sit here with a grey mind and no idea what I'm doing. 


Processing words
<br> a joyless hellhole,

I would rather eat a fire extinguisher.


I will try again tomorrow,<br>

It has been one year and a half or more <br>

I have the impulse to clutter up the space here with more words
but I will try to refrain from doing so. 
<br>
I've already said what I don't remember
<p>
There was a coupon <br>a really good deal <br>
so we put in an order for takeout.
I don't remember what we talked about on the way to pick it up, it was probably nothing in particular. 

We were so hungry on the way home that we had to stop and eat on a bench.
There were pigeons jumping around trying to get a piece of noodle. 
I don't remember what we talked about then, it was probably nothing in particular. 

On the way home 
I remember what we talked about We were thinking of getting a cat. 

</p>
<p>
our new cat <br>
he is a little black cat <br>
his name is mouse 
<br>
he took a nap on a shoebox under the bed
<br>
he slept on my pillow above my head
<br>
he likes to eat my hand
<br>
he is the best friend I have ever had

</p>


I took a shortcut through the field on my way home. <br>
I noticed a cloud in the middle of the grass. <br>

I tore off a piece 
I jumped onto it. It floated upward. 
I jumped off of it and it sunk back into the grass. 
  
Over here, I said and guided a tow truck into the field.

I don't think I'm supposed to drive on the grass here, the tow truck driver said. 

That's alright, I said. I think this cloud must have fallen down

I'll hitch it. the tow truck driver said.

Alright.

he lowered the lift onto the cloud and the cloud began to float upward into the sky.

The tow truck was hooked on the cloud and also started to lift into the sky. 

The tow truck driver screamed.
<br>
Should I jump? The tow truck driver asked. 

no it's too long a long fall, I shouted back.

Come, again? he screamed. 

he was very high up in the sky at this point, almost out of sight.

sitting in the sun and eating rice 

Today I am quite tired from sitting in the sun and eating rice

My girlfriend found a good book in a box outside of someone's house when she was out 

She brought it home and gave it to me as a present. 

I put it up on the wall by my desk and am happy to have it there.

It is important to find the things that you love to do 

and meet people while doing those things. 

Because there is a good chance 

that the people you meet while doing those things 

will be the ones that you love.

I was up very early in the morning 
<br>
thinking
<br>

Things have been peaceful lately.

I am grateful for all of this.

I have been riding my bike through the city over potholes. 
Sometimes I go faster than cars going at 100 mph. 
<br>

At this speed  
The possibility of crashing is never out of the question. 

<br>

It would be nice to drink some water and read

But I bet if I tried right now 
I would only get a few pages in before the book would fall onto the ground 
because I would have fallen asleep while reading it. 

And then I would be woken up by the same book
that put me to sleep

you would agree.

I am considering the demon of the shrill rabbit hole

There was a more detailed thought 
at some point<br>
but on the other hand
no one can attest to what was mentioned <br>
then or in any other instance -- so 
what I will say 
is that knowing you're mistaken <br>
is a surefire way to muster the courage to sacrifice being right.

But alas, these are but mere utterances that the fang protruded from the highway to the grass and the dirt.

How can the hog cross the dirt road <br>

What blessing can be said

and passes the dismal inept trucks 
on his way before 

<p>

I recommend 
that you watch tv  

and eat potato chips 

with your cat and your girlfriend 

and read a book 

and then sleep in  

If that isn't enough, then nothing will be. 
It is the pinnacle 
It is the thrill of it all. 

this pillowcase was likely sent to me in error
I have decided to send it back to the return address --
<p>
A, 
Thank you for your response. Yes, it may be true 
that the only opinion I actually believe in, is my own, and yes it is easy to rebuttal and to defy if the opinion in question isn't aligned with what I want to believe already. 
<br>
I suspect that most people are like this in order to maintain some sense of self that can function in the world, but depending how wrong I am, this could show a huge deficit in my ability to present as a socialized person. 
<br>
Alternatively I can think of a half dozen or so times where my sense of my own opinion and self has become so unhinged that I have lost a great deal, especially in my personal finances... this may be the opposite extreme, and result in the stubbornness you've pointed out, the one I cling to, for safety. 
<br>
I do not aspire to project an overbearing or egregious sense of self as you mentioned, or that I have attempted to describe above. I hope you know I do value a sense of confidence and stability. 
<br>
It is in fact of my opinion that perhaps there is growth that stems from the discourse of these forces and the only real danger is leaning too far into one end or another.
<br>
I will ask that you do advise though. 
<br>
Regards, 
<br>

I couldn't help but notice the audience's criticism <br>
I overheard a woman in a lawn chair say that if only she had known it would have been this bad...<br>  

I cannot deny that I felt sad but on the other hand, I did think it may be for the best -- how would he ever learn without facing such adversity?
<br>
Ruminating on the subject, I came to realize that perhaps that was optimistic. and only a way for me to curb how ashamed I felt for him and inadvertently myself.  
<br>
Perhaps it would be better for him to give up and admit that no matter how hard he practiced or how much adversity he overcame, there was no way for him to win over an audience of that scale. 
<br>
At the end of the day, his ambition and persistence could amount to nothing more than a curse because -- he just isn't very good.
</p>

<p>
Upon listening to the radio this morning I was pleasantly surprised to hear him participating in a live on air interview. 
<br>
I was impressed by his humility as he recollected a conversation he'd had with his daughter, 
<br>
when she confessed that despite the daily embarrassment she felt for him, she admired him deeply, for giving her courage to pursue the things in her life that she would be most ashamed to fail at.  
</p>
<p>
It’s getting colder but 

To be honest 
I don’t know its been pretty quiet there lately on account of everything. 

Perhaps its time to let it go 
</p>
<p>
an attempted eulogy I<br>

This morning I became nostalgic for some writing 
I'd done in the past. 

I spent some time revisiting the work this afternoon.
It had some good aesthetic qualities, but inevitably I would say it was too abstract and melodramatic.

I considered what it would be like if I'd written it now
and the truth is, I would probably throw it out and write something else. 

Maybe I would delete it and write exactly this.
But I must admit that still somehow, after all of these years, I can't seem to let it go entirely. 

The truth is there was a sincerity and a perfection to that writing that I don't know if I will ever beat.
And for that I must respect it, for outliving the rest and refusing to die.
<br>
an attempted eulogy II 
<br>
I became attached to the idea 
of saying nothing 

and I came close 
enough in doing so 

to realize
that the only way to say nothing is to not say anything at all.

It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge 
the ways in which I attempted to fill the space
the vacuum, the absurdity, the effort.

Perhaps I'd tricked myself into thinking that saying nothing, with the conviction of being,
had value or meaning. 

Perhaps succeeding at saying nothing is only a failure in saying something,
and I will criticize it,
as foolish, cowardly,
aesthetically rich 
and transcendently bankrupt.
<br>
an attempted eulogy III
<br>
a single bolt of lighting struck a bowl of soup
and eviscerated the noodles 

the customers shared the broth and despite learning it was a rerun 
continued watching the football match on television

there was a plank of wood leaning against a wall in a basement which no one knew about
it has been melodramatic to say the least 

elsewhere a seagull flies around 
considering a way to exorcise its neurosis 

but is unwilling to defy the wisdom of its upbringing 
having being raised by the ghost of a raccoon 
<br>
an attempted eulogy IV

Somehow it seemed like the failure to be understood was a mark of uniqueness and originality and that the eternal tabula rasa'ing was a sign of fearlessness, but the truth was that the vhs tapes with the hours and hours of pointless blurry seagull and cloud footage, amounted to nothing more than a vague etherial sentiment to the person who recorded it.

Passing through the dirt, churning raw milk,<br>

I am proud to admit that I finished reading my library book today.

It was very long –– five hundred and thirty eight pages. 

I wonder what it would be like to write a book that is over five hundred pages. 

Maybe one day I will give it a shot. But for now, these sentences will have to do.

</p>
<p>

I already have my next book checked out from the library.

It’s just over two hundred pages. I’m looking forward to reading it.

</p>

<p>

I am looking forward to resting my head this evening 
and watching a bit of tv
with my girlfriend 
and my cat. 
</p>
<p>
I am unconcerned with any other reward
for the foreseeable future.Tomorrow morning I will read my book on the couch while my cat runs circles around the room
<br>
Earlier this morning I was reading a book on the couch while my cat ran circles around the room.
There were sentences I glazed over, that I may never return to. 
<br>
When I was in the shower, as my coffee was brewing,  
I dog eared a thought because it seemed like I had something to say about it, but now that I am here, I'm unsure what it was exactly.
<br>
Perhaps it had something to do with the memory I have –– imagining it for the first time.
When the dust went on the ground 
and a lot of people realized 
they needed the pizza box 
to use as a dustpan. 

This would be the pizza box 
stacked 
in the hallway.

Some people thought that the dust was from etherial dead skin,
others thought the wind had blown it in off a hacksaw somewhere 
and others thought it was only created by time. 
<br>
You can say what you will about what you think is right
but I'll always side with the snail crates
<br>
and I understand how offended you are but frankly I still believe you’re dead wrong.
<br>
Yes, perhaps I could have phrased my message in a more cordial manner but who even cares at this point? 
<br>
You knew full well that the truck was packed to the brim with those snail crates and you still insisted on bringing your dog
<br>
What did you think would happen?
<br>
the black foot truck stop 
<p>
Most people liked going to that restaurant for their 24 hour breakfast. 
</p>

nostalgia 

A calculator 
was ditched in the snow 
on the side of the road. 

The battery was long dead 
but there was a small solar panel 
built into the top of it. 

Each day the sun melted the snow, bit by bit, until finally 
one morning, the calculator turned on. 
Every night the calculator would die, and every morning it was revived. because of the solar panel on it.

 –– a man, wearing a ski jacket,  
was on his way 
and noticed the calculator on the side of the road. 
he picked the calculator off of the ground 
and put it into his pocket.

The server brought a window. 
He looked longingly through the parking lot, past the road –– 

and vaguely transfixed by something past the melting snow and the passing trucks,
he had lost himself somewhere in recollection of the moment he'd first found 
There was mildew  
in the ceiling 
<br>
A fellow pointed it out 
The waitress  
and brought a ladder, a spray bottle, a sponge and rubber gloves from the back. 

She climbed up the ladder and started scrubbing. 
He kept telling her where to step and how to go about it. 

She lost her temper twice before he finally went for it. 
He got down on his knee and offered her the diamond ring that he'd bought her. 

The mildew had been there so long, 
it was truly a wonder she hadn't noticed it before.
</p>

<p>

The booths have been reupholstered twice in the past seven years.  

It was an odd choice the second time around. 

The fabric has a print of that shows a pattern of Highway 61 graphics –– which is nowhere close to where they're located. 


I saw a bunch of magpies puttering out on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant last time I was there. 

On his way out, on accident, A whacked one of them with the front door and knocked it halfway to the gas pump.

A lot of stories went around after that. About what A didn't or didn't do. 
 
sitting with a glass of tap water 
waiting for the ice to melt,
I am trying to concentrate on my thoughts 

The ceiling 
as an ornament 
cannot transcend itself 
in this very moment 
but if there was a cavity in it, 
due to a defect 
in its design
or something ...  
I would be interested in what that might be like </p>
<p>
I spoke on the phone

To wj
Who assured me


That they would arrive in time.
There is nothing else I can do
Or perhaps more specifically, I should say there is nothing else I am willing to do.

At the moment everyone is going to have to either A) wait until tomorrow or B) do their job for a living 

This happens so often I can't say I'm surprised. 

find a way to solve the problem with what we have <br>
I'm sorry you now know I'm willing to lie to you in order to get the job done but I want to get home in time for dinner
<br>

What is any of this worth if not for that?

the sky splashes the water
off the hillside and wades in the water. 
looking on going farther down. 
Past the sky out the window of the cloud's helm.
There are many clouds in the sky, but one in particular separates from the bunch and plummets downward towards it into the mud. 
<br>

out for dinner  
he asked what was behind my anger. 

I responded, what anger?
because I did not feel angry. 

I began to feet embarrassed that he thought I was angry 
and then I began to feel angry, that he thought I angry.

He's not dead, but we're out of touch. 
I may never even see him again. 
But I suppose it 
is always prevalent.

sparks burst from a power line and good coleslaw passes it over.

if you happen to see any termites wearing any blue or pink friendship bracelets in the next few days…not last week
but then, two nights ago 
<p>
succumbing to failure 
<br>to admit –– 
the utility of the act is nothing short of an embarrassment
to neglect is its own torture 
and the complacency is rot so –– we are here
</p>
<p>
a good sum of cash and sentiment 
a notion out there that 
it's ok –– because you did it for yourself 
disingenuously sentimental
it is for ourselves and our money 
in part, it has the most money 
in part, the ability to work hard must be the reward in itself
fortune, ownership 
It is obvious that by no means am I thinking 
of the glow of the coil.
to get through everything right now, but I guess at the end of the day he probably just needs the cash.

a clock by sheer coincidence 
as a minute. Everyone thinks I am so slow  
to continue his sentence 
for what seemed like an eternity –– 
but was in fact only sixty seconds...
How can anyone be expected to understand your worth if you cannot even see it yourself
And with that the sauce simmered away into the depths of the pan

the holy sabbath 

two guys trying to jam the truck door back into the battery truck on the side of the highway exit 
<br>
a llama eats a roll of carpet from the carpet factory dumpster 
<br>
triplet jam jars roll down the snow, on the hillside 
<br>
I wish to take credit for all of it 
my involvement was limited 
</p>

to the money tree, <br>

thank you for being there –– 
for those years ... 

when it was just me in my old apartment 
it meant something to see you bend towards the sun 


I will await the day our paths cross again 
and in the meantime, I will say thank you 
for your resilience  
and for being there 
</p>
<p>

in a tall box 
...behold the big sky
and the clouds 
... off on some southern prairie trail 
out of nowhere –– a herd of bighorn sheep 
leaving nothing but a cloud of dust 
over the rocks, through the dirt over the hill 
until –– for seemingly no reason at all 
the dog stopped

for no good reason
he just stopped –– they got back in the car and went home and that was that 

but I'm telling you,  ––  it happened and they seemed grateful enough, all things considered 
</p>
<p>


I was walking down the street 
across from the church... 

it was weird, <br>I saw a guitar amp tipped over, in the middle of the road 
<br>
and I don't know why I did this exactly 
but I went into the street and stood under its shadow
<br>
all the cars kept speeding by, most of them not even swerving out of the way 
I thought about going into the church and asking if it was theirs... 
but instead, I went to the pawn shop and dumped it onto the counter
the guy there looked at it and 
he took note of the damage. I told him it just got like that from all the years of good use

and then he said –– he could give me twenty bucks for it, but he was pretty sure this is the same model that my church uses and I heard they were missing their amp,</p>
<p> so how about this, he said, I'll give you forty bucks to go return it to them for me...
<br>
I took the forty bucks and walked a few blocks
but then my arms got tired so I tossed it off the side of a bridge and watched it smash on the road 
<br>
on my way back I started feeling guilty 
that guy gave me forty bucks and I didn't come through for him 
but then again what were they doing leaving their amp in the middle of the road?

so I went all the way down to bottom of the bridge 
and just as I thought 
the amp was totally smashed to bits
I went to go get the pieces that were salvageable but then a massive truck came and it smashed the those bits down to even smaller bits 
<br>
still, I did what I could and I collected the pieces 
and I brought them all back to the church 
<br>
they seemed grateful enough, all things considered 

the guilt has been lingering a bit, <br>
but if I'm being honest, I think I did the right thing in the end 

</p>
<p>

a bag of soil was thrown off the balcony 
and hit the wheelbarrow –– 

the soil went everywhere 
all over the snow 
maybe like an oreo cookie 

and now the wheelbarrow is gone 
ask anyone –– no ones seen it 

it would have made a good stool to get up to the electrical box 
when the breakers flip

there was so much crap in the way before
the air conditioner exhaust tube... 
we cleaned it all up –– and now –– especially as I have never seen the way in which an axe would split through cactus 
and how lightning strikes upwards but  

admittedly, it was my fault 
for so blatantly expressing my distaste with the way the money was handled 
<br>
originally my plan was to stay in my office 
with the radiator 
and my computer
and my lawn chair 
and cheese cloth,
and grass, <br>
and electricity 
and dirt 
and eels
and worms 
<br>
there is snow on the ground now 
and 
we don't know where the worms sleep 
if they all die and reincarnate in the spring 
<br>
or become spaghetti 
<br>
and die in spaghetti boxes
</p>

<p>
the button on the top of the window 
that makes all of the files organize themselves by name 
or date created, or size 
–– I am trying to figure out how to do that for papers in real life 
<br>
eternal damnation, life insurance 
<br>now that there is snow on the ground 
some of the tents have been catching fire 

my cousin's house caught fire yesterday as well 
he is a realtor –– the irony is meaningless as far as I can tell 

my cousin's house and the tents have little to do with one another 
even though they have both burned to ash 
and my brain has melted into flamingo meat 
</p>
<p>
I will recommend cremating it and using the remnants as fireworks <br>

tumbleweed blows between two sneering fireworks
and a waterfall recycles itself through a pacman exit </p>
<p>
sense the new multitudes of fear, that my library books overdue

<br>I had been frivolously writing something 
when I found out that you had died </p>
<p>

maybe the clouds would divide heaven from the sky
if heaven as a layer of the sky was something to believe 

I know how hard it was for you, while you were here 
I remember your bravery 
and the door you held open for me

perhaps it is time 
to forget humility
and take the digger to the graveyard 
proverbially speaking, of course 
and despite their ongoing interpersonal problems 
and their inability to reconcile their grievances 
they will still have some people that will be there for them  
— and in the end they will get the money 
<br>
This ending will please many people 
as what more can anyone ask for 
than the right to an opinion 
a couple of friends 
and a bag of money.

<p>
the exhaustion was impossible to transpire <br>
they arrived on the counter top inexplicably <br>
I realized my spinal chord was missing <br>
I could see it there on the coffee table, 
it did not look damaged or broken
</p>

<p>
he forgot or something <br>
I got distracted and saw a car battery on the side of the road  
<br> in the end the coils were too crusted over with acid 
it was worthless 

I got distracted on purpose 
</p>
<p>
crumpled next to the blue plastic water bottle
–– that sits on the edge of the table 
remiss to note that the direction of the sun 
remains irrelevant as ever 
in the way the light bends through the window 
sentimental, critical, 
the nerve I have to then worry
and worse –– to take offence 
to think poorly of them 
for thinking poorly of me

the crab shell washes up on the shore

I will float this glass across the room until it vanishes <br>
formidable dust 
blows off the dust 
and sends it onto the ground 
–– I do not know where the dust ends up 
when it hits the ground 

</p>
<p>
on the way home I stopped at a shed 
and ordered two rice pouches 

they came in a paper bag 
and were still warm by the time I got home 

Mouse jumped up on the kitchen table 
and Miriam took a break from her work so we could eat them together 

on my deathbed I will remember that little table 
and how it was good to be home 
</p>
<p>
the void 
–– with a knife in it 
that has a pink color and snow on its leavesI looked inside the pocket of my old jacket and found an old crumpled tissue 
from eleven winters ago
the crusted snot –– it is all good man
<br>
I may have been at the hockey game 
sitting and
eating fries with my dad. 
<br>
or looking out the window of a bus 
</p>
<p>
I will look forward to a hot cup of coffee 
a  minnow in the cup 
I tried to catch it 

Mouse pawed at it
and caught it and ate it

beside the east facing conveyor belt  
<br>
I have remembered something–– 
inside the warehouse 
there is a nail 
standing upright 
beside the east facing conveyor belt <br> 
you have to look closely to find it 
but it's there

the warehouse has no insulation 
but its still warmer than the outside 
so at night there a lot of deer sleeping on the conveyer belts 
<p>
this morning –– 
I was lucky to find an old heater 
from the basement 
I put it beside my desk 

it kept me warm throughout the day 
as I completed my work 
</p>
<p>
I did not build the dam 
–– I'm not sure where I'll get my water from</p>


my cat ripped up a whole paper bag from the library yesterday  

he loves eating cans of fish 
and looking out the window 
and messing with his toys 

he loves wrestling 
and climbing 
and cuddling up on a blanket 

every time he wakes up from a nap 
I am excited to hang out with him 
he is the best  
</p>
<p>I must admit my computer 
moments
<br>I would be a fool <br>

</p>
<p>
outside the vet
I saw a man crying in his truck <br>
I cannot blame him for breaking down <br>

few things are as sacred <br>
few human relationships can compare <br>

still we got Mouse neutred <br> 
it is so fucking sad to do that<br>

He came home ravenous 
he tore through his food and both the cones we had for him 
he destroyed the room 
we called the emergency vet 
they did not know what to do 
<br>
none of the meds could calm him down 
we barely slept 
he fought to hell for his freedom 
and eventually he won, rendering us utterly hopeless
<br>

after assuring our defeat –– he finally slept, and it has been almost twelve hours 
he comes up for the occasional pet 
or a snack or a sip of water 
...I've never seen anyone so exhausted 
he is resting now 
but slowly starting to act like his old self 

</p>
<p>

I am not so sure I can tell you what I know 
in my desk drawer
the pigeon, a pigeon went into the department 
as a sole proprietor 
and knocked over a box 
it was strange 
when it
flapped into the lights 

–– the fluorescent glass 
all over the receipt books 
and nobody knew until days later –– <br>
it is okay not to consider the things that have happened 
when the fireplace has melted itself 
and the union fees have been paid by an anonymous donor 
and there is a lot of snow on the ground

</p>
<p>

I was able to read just over two hundred pages this weekend 
and I hope to finish the chapter I'm on tonight
</p>

the spider 
climbs the walls of the jar 
<p>
I will look forward to drinking my water and finishing these books
<br>
I remember the staircase that led up to the restroom 
<br>
the dandruff that would be on the front of my shirt 
<br>
I still have two books out from the library that I haven’t finished 
I am determined to finish them before they have to go back on monday 
</p>
<p>
few people will believe what happened here today... 
it is something even bigger than you can imagine 
<br>
trying to leak the toilet 
I lifted a portion of it 
before my cat jumped onto the edge of it 

<br>

<p>
the shadow of a tree and the tree 

and a new computer 
at the bottom 
</p>
<p>
I have brought it into my office 
I am quite scared, 
I will type in the password

</p>
<p>
I didn't feel great 
in a way <br>
it was looking like I'd wasted the last few months <br>

but today, 
I have brought a new computer into my office 
</p>
<p>

I am sitting here looking at this <br>
wondering what the hell went wrong<br>
from the ceiling 
a can opener incision
sparked onto the carpet 
<br>
these are things a lot of people know 
but not many choose 
to accept 
for instance 
tomorrow morning 
I will read a chapter of my book 
the more I think about it the more –– I would recommend it to anyone 
and I wonder what they would say 
the occasional message from a friend 
I'm not sure there is much else to it </p>
<p>
there are two library books that I didn't read in time 
before they had to go back 
I feel guilty 
and that I have failed 
but I suppose one day  
I can get those book again 
and have a second chance
</p>

<p>

good 
measuring tape 
has become a femur bone 
and the spritzer bottle 
plywood falls into the mud 
and splashes a puddle 
and icicles pour from the sinksthe lampshade, the urinal dust 

if they kick it across the room I don't know if it will land back on the lamppost 
dust floats through the air 
and by a cat 
...when he opens his palm 
he is surprised to find nothing 

perhaps it wasn't the dust
it was just the shadow of the dust 

garbage day comes...
the static comes in from a satellite dish...

</p>
<p>

cardboard <br>
I need exhaustion 
having finished 
the shrew wisdom <br>

where the wisdom serves no one
it is just 
in the glue 
in slippers and robe 
the power outage 
was blamed on a twig on the ground 
combined with a thermostat 

...ask the guard 
he will tell you whose fault it was 

a very high up cloud <br>
— the final depth of hell 

a few days later... the seagull returned
and became a demon worse than satan 
</p>
<p>
and now it lives in the dumpster of the restaurant 
there is no remorse for the wrath that awaits 
</p>


the park has a lot of dirt on the ground
and some of the dirt around the snow has become mud 
from all of the melting <br>
I will find myself wearing sunglasses
<br>
sad to see them 
hidden under the rug 
<br>
I tried them out
but my face had become strange
and for a moment –– I forgot who I was 
<br>
after that moment... it has slowly been coming back to me 
...but I can't quite grasp it... 

...one thing I know for sure... is that things will never be the same again
I can't go back to the person I was 
<br>
I had to make sure all of my e-mails have been checked 
<br>but a massive gust of wind came from the window...
<br>
I will mention as well... last night I dreamt that I was staring at a photocopier light...
and this morning when I was brushing my teeth I noticed one of my molars was gone... 
I've realized that maybe it's best to keep the windows closed when it is so windy <br>
and at the best of times
I would have no idea what to say to you <br>
I have accepted ten thousand dollars <br>

many people have wondered the status 
many people have demanded to know what is going on...

but on second thought... I have decided to say nothing 
in this case... it is better to speak into a walkie talkie on a channel no one is listening to 

it is for the best 

thank you for the rv 
it was terrible
the this woman it
drove it against a pole four times 
<br>
I did everything I had to do 
to get it out of my sight </p>
<p>
a small feather
was on the screw driver 
that was used to take the deadbolt off the door 
<br>
it was rusted shut 
and nobody could open it 
until they put a small feather on the screw driver 

I'm not sure who figured it out 
I know this one guy is trying to take the credit
but everyone knows it wasn't him 
and that he is a facetious liar
<br>
I have no problem saying that he was a facetious liar 
even publicly 
because the guy is out of control
<br>
the truth is I hope one day to reconcile with him
because it's not good to have another enemy out there
so maybe when I see him again 
I'll ask him how it's been going lately 
</p>
<p>
the wax, the soil, the mud

the continuation of when the wax has become burned to the bottom of the beehive

the continuation of the flower pot 
when the soil has spilled onto the ground
and the worms have become ouroboros 

the continuation of the nile 
when the mud has dried to toothpaste

I am trying to come home 
but it has been difficult 
–– everyone has an opinion 

</p>

<p>

I will have a sip of water and relax 
<br>

it has come time 
to look at the books 
<br>
I have many cheques to write tomorrow 
probably one hundred 
<br>
great
<br>
I am exhausted
<br>
but I have my ten thousand dollars 
and now I will go back to my writing
</p>
<p>

I continue to wake up thinking of trucks 
and scaffolding 
falling onto the road 
<br>
the sky and a cloud 
...eventually another cloud 
<br>
it must be learned the hard way
and many people must witness the failure  
if it is to be worth the while to gowhere no trucks return and no trucks belong

</p>
<p>
a stick on the sidewalk
has a leaf coming out of it 
<br>
it is strange be home 
when a bag of soil has spilled all over the road 
<br>
I am wondering what will happen to that stick 
if it will drop onto someone's head –– as a prank 
<br>
perhaps tomorrow I will go to find that stick again
and perhaps tomorrow I will forget it even exists
<br>
too close to understanding 
most often –– it is impossible to understand why people do the things they do 
<br>
my attempt to find a reason 
has proven frivolous so far
<br>

it is difficult to admit that I currently don’t care
<br>

tomorrow I will see how it goes 
<br>
but now it has come time to look inside the garbage can 
<br>
and remove this shoebox full of twenty dollar bills
<br>

afterward I will get a cup 
and fill it with water
and I will drink the water  
and then I will wash the cup 

and leave it to dry 
before putting it back in the cupboard 
</p>
<p>


each day when I return to the keyboard to grapple with the page –– 
it is strange to realize how difficult it is to progress, reasonably 

the discomfort is unparalleled 
despite my weariness, I have learned to trust it, for the most part.

</p>

<p>

I would like to spend some time thinking about my supper 
a hamburger and fries — it was great
and I was happy to watch tv while I ate it

I also gave my cat a can of supper as well 
he ate it and licked his paws 
and now he is taking a quick nap 

it is peaceful for the moment.
but I know he will be up again soon and when he wakes up 
he will be ready to wreak havoc again

</p>

a racoon walks across the stoop 
the moon goes through a cloud

the dust releases from the ground 
and sprinkles back into the sky 

the racoon retreats across the stoop 
the moon fades behind the cloud 
a cobweb has been lingering between the radiator for a long time.
and I am concerned 

perhaps I have stripped the bolt 
in trying too hard to loosen it 

I am weary to fall into self pity and to admit failure 

</p>

I was wrong about the doormat, folded in the dumpster 
and that is fine 
because I intend to keep our doormat 
it has been through a lot
and I think it could last for many more years 

–– the doormat has not been folded
it was just a reflection from the glass on the door 

it is possible to be wrong 
and it is possible to be wrong, often 

being with people is necessary, but not always easy to manage 
and for the most part I feel like I have it anchored 

but I am wrong sometimes, 
and sometimes I am wrong often

perhaps the doormat has been folded...
but there is no room in the dumpster for it 
and that is fine 
because I want to keep our doormat 
it has been through a lot
and I think it could last for many more years

I have enjoyed playing chess online 
with my buddy from back home
<br>
we can play many simultaneous games 
the computer can generate infinite chess boards 
<br>
I have played a few strangers on the site 
and it's kind of fun -- but not as good as playing a friend <br>
it helps to play chess 
and lose, and know that it's no ones fault but your own 
<br>
it's humbling to say the least 
<br>
my Dad taught me how to play when I was a kid

a stack of papers I will read over tomorrow 

we used to record the episodes off the tv and watch them again and again 

and now here I am, a little bit older

I am glad everyone is okay 
for the moment 
it is difficult to remember how temporary it is 
it can be hard to concentrate 
</p>
<p>
the concern 
that I must address
is regarding
the library and the bookstore 

at the moment, I will be honest –– there are no books I am too excited about reading
which is preposterous
but true 
unfortunately <br>
it can be hard to concentrate 
on a book
even though I would love to take some time 
to read <br>
there is a part where she writes a recipe for a grilled cheese sandwhich and eats a grilled cheese sandwich 
and the police are at her house
that I was happy to read
</p>
<p>
I have carried a massive irritation <br>
I'm not sure I'm as concerned with it as I should be 
but perhaps I can put my finger on it 

sometimes 
the little bastard catches fire 
too much too fast –– 
<br>blaming the fire 

I once saw a guy, starving –– he blew out the flame 
and here was a backdraft and he burnt his mouth 
<br>
patiently to the core
<br>
–– carry the massive irritation 
<br>
–– be concerned

for thirteen and a half hours

I tried not to be impatient 
I read half a book
considering yesterday's bastardization of the pylon honour

<p>
considering yesterday's bastardization 
of the pylon honour... 
<br>
perhaps I was angry 

but as a pylon... 
I could manage to turn pages

reviewing the clarity 

pylons over concrete 
seldom figment 
</p>
<p>

I had at one point thought it would be a good idea
overwhelmed by my love 
as I reflect back now on my impulse to write  
I cannot help but feel slightly hollow
merely a figment in this context

...sometimes the knife is not sharp enough to cut through 

the day <br>
every day 

sometimes

I suppose that is the high
I am after

not an escape 
but the time when the eyes must be ghoulish

I am only trying to carve a simple skull 

but 

in the end 

the eyes must be damning 

–– but I will sharpen my sheath, I will try again

I was in the car with my Dad <br>
I felt that things weren't going too well for me <br>
he told me to be persistent & patient <br>

It wasn't much more than a mutter on his behalf
but I've tried to stick with it <br>

refining–– tuning 
aiming towards the core 

<p>
catching the fly, only to set it free
...will see how it goes

I've quit and sold my desk, 
and my chair and my keyboard 
for a mule

we've been standing outside the costco 
for work 
<br>
for the most part 
we're dragging flats of soda and hummus and things like that
across town 
to people's homes 

some people buy too much to fit in their cars 
so we're 
hauling the overflow
<br>
business has been improving 
and I'm making more money than I was writing 

we're usually pretty tired when we get home 
I dump a bucket of water on the mule's head
to cool him down

we sit and watch the sunset 
eating carrots
and trying to get some rest 
before the next day begins

small 
towards no guarantee outcome
with no guarantee of returning 
unless in his grave 
perhaps severed or 
pierced by the fang 

it was an act 
that was true,
inarguably so 

a fool raged in the hellish sun 
though the lightning 
and upon saving his family 
he was considered a hero 
undoubtably so 
here lies the demon we defeated
the yard hallowed , sleeping at the foot of the bed

</p>

<p>

the water from the faucet 
pours into the sink 
annd back to the bell tower
looking upward 
the falcon that was there 
and we looked at the falcon 
and someone said that it lived in the church across the street 
in the bell tower 
with another falcon 
and someone told their child not to go closer 
since the child was no larger than the falcon 
and as the falcon stood on the branch 
a baby bird called out from its nest, for help 
and the falcon took the baby bird 
and dropped it down, from its nest to the dirt 
and all of the people gasped
and the baby bird was dead 
and we marvelled at the falcon’s wingspan 
when it flew off 
and went back to the bell tower

I carved out the tape 
in dust, 
I have been walking in
dirtand  grass 

I am my slippers 
all things considered

a great feeling 
and not expensive, 

I should be home 
</p>

<p>
the noticed light 
dialling in from the lid 

it is thoughtful and of a cloud passing the sky
<br>
and to rebar and the giant tongue 

I present to you both
water <br>

thank you 

</p>


away from the river

trying to take me around some dirt

I hopped off 
and fell into the dirt

we came to the river 
and we stood there and looked at it 

the water rushing 
over the rocks

the clouds across the river 

we walked further 

I stood and considered offering my arm 
I was just going to eat the guy's head

I tossed the till into a ditch maybe along the way 
we continued on  
a flashing light 
reflecting off the horse's eye

coming from the road
the cop shot me  
and I became tangled in the rein
being dragged along the river rocks 

<br>
I drank the water from the river
I was thirsty for a long time 


and the dust settled –– after we crossed the river 
</p>

<p>
lying in the dirt 
out of the grass 
to the store to buy a new shirt and jeans and a hat 

his family always said they hated him 
and his friends said that too

and so you can know his redemption is true and he is a good man 
it doesn’t seem like I will get to enjoy my cup of coffee in the meantime
while I sit and read my book <br>a page 
about people 

if the things that happened to them 
made them who they are 

if it was the way they were born 


perhaps who they are 
meant something 
</p>
<p>

grass is so strange 
I don’t even know the point of it

it is nice to rip from the ground
every once in a while 

 it is good 
for the land 

the cloud came from the sky and lowered into the field 

the sun was a circle of yellow 
and the cloud left the field and went back into the sky

the grass will not move 

we will wait, 
to see  
</p>
<p> 
concerned that the leaf was stupid 

and its shadow dumb 
and there is no wind  


through the wing of the leaf 

the tree will grow over the season
and there will be shade for the ant hill 

we have been eating the skull of our friend 

and the skull to be something to fetch 
back to the road 

and there was a woman 
who was going to visit our friend
and she did not recognize the skull at first 

but when she got to the grave 
and saw the hole at the base of the grave 
she understood what the dog had dug up 

she was unsure what to do 
she was frightened 
she would chase the dog and get the skull back
but it was of no use, 
it have just become dirt in the end

she would fix the hole that the dog had made
it occurred to her as she went back to the road 

she looked at the sun, and followed the direction of her shadow </p>
<p>

carrying a skull in his mouth the dog ran 
past the well where the water had become dry and on until nighttime when the moon was white and blinding like the sun
the woman, swollen and coughing from pollen had become burnt by the glare of the moon but came to the deck that the dog hid beneath  
<br>
the tree she imagined was very far from here and she had sold it 
she was prowling towards the two eyes that bead under the deck
the dog would not flinch 
towards the dog, the dog clenched its teeth gripping the eye sockets of our friend's skull 
and it darted off, past the moon 
the woman, wounded, her neck and ankles pierced fell to her knees and sunk her nails into the grass, ripping handfuls and howling in agony 

there was the sun 
and the dog 
who slept 
and the woman 
staring up at him
he raised his neck
and tilted his head 

she grabbed him by the scruff
and said 
"you damn dog 
where'd you hide it"
and the boy came from the house
kicking open the screen door 

"listen lady 
get your hands off my damn dog"

they walked to the yard 
the skull bone was white in the sun 
the woman looked upward 
towards a cloud that passed through our friend's skull 

"that was our friend. you're a bastard kid, you're a real damn bastard" 
<br>

the woman's neck, blistered by the sunlight 
she does not know which way to go 
"my dog will go that way after breakfast you can follow him"

"I'm not following that damn dog one more step" 
the boy slams his cup of milk against the wall 

she follows the boy through the tall grass
and the dog speeds past them 
"someone's going to put an end to that dog you know" 

"someone's going to put an end to you lady" 
she grabs the boy by the shoulder


she covers the boy's mouth with her hand
a shadow looms over them, shading them from the hellish sun 

and into the sun, extending, into the dirt

the woman vomits
"this knife isn't big enough" 
"jesus man" the woman says

they continue to walk
eventually there is the truck 
covered in layers of mold and pollen and dust 

the woman reaches into the trunk 
and there is an axe. 
the boy holds the axe, angling the dullness of its edge 

they drive through the tall grass 
and they use the axe 
to retrieve the hallowed skull 

and lift into the back of the truck 
and the tooth pierces through the woman's hand 
in agony 
a ray of sunlight shining through her palm 
it is difficult for the woman to know
"it's your hand now or your arm later" the boy says 

the woman holds her hand on the gas tank 
and looks away as the boy takes off her hand
it is severed after many swings 

her screams scatter into the earth and the boy tosses her hand 
into the earth
and when she asks where her hand is, he says he does not know 

they go to the truck 
"give me the keys" says the boy 

the woman, delirious, pale and sun stroked 
reaches into her bloody jeans 
and there are the keys 

the boy will try to start the engine but to no avail 
they will have to push the truck
like a wagon toward our friend's grave 

<br>
along the truck 
the small rocks
went into the tire 

our friend's spine 
and the woman walked towards it 
the boy unloading the truck

they dragged the skull 
towards the dirt 
sacrificing it, to our friend 

it was a strange funeral 
with few words 
and it did not last long 

the boy shovelled the dirt 
and the woman drove him back to the road 

and as the boy walked through the field
he felt as though the woman did not like him 
and he felt that she would have preferred they had never met 

the boy felt a disdain and an anger towards the woman 

the boy would have wanted the woman to like him

he looked towards the light
and towards the road 
the truck driving onward 

the woman's hand severed
her wrist 
hung from the window

he watched her down the road 
and she saw the boy in the mirror and she felt pity for him 
<br>
in the evening the boy sat on his porch 
and there came the dog 
running through the grass

in the dog's jaw 
the woman's hand 
he dropped it down in front of the boy 

and the dog panted 
and he was happy to see the boy 
whose hat rested on his knee 

the boy patted his dog on the head
they would sit there 
until there was no light
<br>

the woman filled her basket and paid good money
she thought of her grandfather who once grilled his shirt and ate it 
for no other reason than to prove that he would 

the fire was dull and lame 
there were many logs in the pile and she took one and tossed it into the flame 

she took off her shirt and stabbed a stick through it and began to roast it 
the fabric folded into itself and it took a shape that reminded her of something she once saw on television 

the smoke opened from the shirt and like her grandfather she would not wait for it to cool before eating it 
and she took a bite of the shirt and chewed it and its taste was un-flavourful and meaningless 

swallowing the shirt felt harsh on her throat and each time she swallowed she felt claustrophobic
and fearful of this idiotic result 

it was clear her grandfather was a fool 
and perhaps that was the wisdom gained in this heinous act  

she went back to the truck and ate and sat on the hood of the truck 
back towards the road

still the woman sits on the hood of the truck 
watching each moment of the sun as it appears from the grass and her shadow occurs, expanding into night

and onwards for days 
until she gets back into the truck and drives along the road 

it was strange to her, the way the light and darkness continued to eclipse her 
she could not see onto the road ahead, but still continued to drive 
and she returned to the road where the boy was 
and crossed through the field and arrived at his home 

she arrived and he let her in
and they sat in silence until he slammed his fist onto the table 

and he demanded to know what she wanted from him 
and she was unsure 

he told her that their time had come to an end 
and there was nothing more to know  

and he sent her back into the truck
and kicked the truck until she drove away 

and she returned back to her home 
and looked back at the sun and looked back at the moon 

she considered that after the light 
and the lack of light 

she had misunderstood what it meant 
and she would sit on the hood of the truck

for more days and she would watch each moment of the sun as it appeared from the grass and her shadow occurred, expanding into night
and she would realize that she did understand 

and she got back into her truck 
and drove back towards the road where the boy was the sun and the moon, the dirt and the grass

the boy was surprised to see the truck return 
the woman walked towards him 
starving and delirious 
having eaten nothing but her shirt and having looked at the sun and the moon as they traded places for many days

the boy could her face and her relentless attempt 
and he became sympathetic  
for her severed hand that decomposed in the yard 

she felt that he deserved not be left on his own 
and that is what he deserved 

and he would share with her the remainder of the milk that he had left
and she would tell him about the sun and the moon 
and he would not pay attention, he would be thinking of the dirt and the grass 
another cloud would return and continue tomorrow 
a cloud, decimated and un-climactic

in the sun the cloud had felt like it had failed 
its purpose siphoned to an accidental death 

perhaps the cloud would return 
and continue on tomorrow 

</p>








<p>
there are people who sit on their porch
as a mere blur 
a rock flying through air is difficult to clarify its intent 

which rock 
which cloud 
or tree
or river 

I am in no mood to
and I have not been 
in a long time 


it is moving through the air 

That said, I would not forget
the truck when it arrives 

I have twenty five dollars cash on me 
I hope that will be enough 

onto the porch I will read my book and consider all of the books I have not read
and for that reason I do not know that the truck comes from up the road 

from the dirt 
the field 
accumulating failure 
for more money and in the interviews they will say that it isn't about the money 

or the recognition, or anything like that 

or his failures will amount to nothing but more failures 
</p>
<p>

also around that time 

I wrote 
and when I finished it, I printed it off the computer and the paper had perforated edges 

I brought the note with me 
I kept it in my pocket and I didn't show it to anyone 

and now here I am
after my life spent 
from the dirt 
no taller than the grass

the grass shifts 
but the persistent bastard does not waver by the grass
<br>
the dust 

the character who stands with his head
the character who will walk into the wall
its feet moving perpetually 
the one who repeats the same line 
over and over again

a recursive character
unsure of success
if any, 

admittedly 
–– emptying to vacuum into the trash
the dust lingering in the air 
the character 
coughs out the dust
the character continues to walk into the wall
and also coughs out the dust
the one who repeats the same line over and over again
and still coughs out the dust 

I noticed the faces,
the two fellows there 
each with long eyes  

and to say hello 
to the bastard feeling

I am perhaps an absent person 
as of late

I am trying to think of a way to describe it 
</p>

<p>

a movie ticket 
was printed 
from the automatic machine 
<br>
the person with the movie ticket went
<br>
and it was hard to admit 
that it was a terrible movie 

the person was sad on the way home 
they were sorry 
about what had happened 
and about the money wasted 

and the truck goes down the road 
past the grass 
and it becomes night 
and then day 
and then night again 

and the truck continues down the road 
to the hill and the sun

and it stops and turns off of the road 
and it drives through the grass
and the trees 

the the person stops 
and takes a jerry can 
and refuels the tank 

and the truck continues driving through the grass 
and the trees
and snapping the sticks in its tire 

and it becomes night 
and then day 
and then night again 

and again the person stops 
and takes a jerry can 
and refuels the tank 

the truck arrives at water
it drives towards it,  
and into it 

it becomes night 
and then day 
and then night again 

and the water continues to onto the trucks
for days and night and years and onward
until the truck become curved and smooth 

and it becomes a kind of rock at the foot of the water 
even to the grass 
</p>


<p>
there are many pointless emails 
that are delivered 

they go inside of pylons 
and are booted off the side of the cliff 

the pylon splashes into the water 
the emails get corrupted 

the pylon floats 
to the graveyard of emails 

the water is thick with moss 
the mosswater leads towards a truck 
</p>

<p>
yesterday, water splashed

on my pad of paper 

I am considering buying a new pair of slippers 

I have found a pair that are blue and come at a good price 


</p>

<p>

failure
and the complete collapse of failure 
the water is still
and the sun beats down onto it –– and it does not reflect back
</p>
<p>
a dirt 
envelope <br>
the message inside of it is mostly irrelevant 

at one point there was a time to be concerned 
but that time has passed 
and here we are  

as milquetoast 

I am unsure what it will have to do with<br>
something or other 

I will accept the money into my bank account 
for walking across the field 

I will become exhausted 
and covered in mosquito bites and spider bites 

that will swell on the top of my skull 
and behind my ear 
and a gas can will get hucked into the grass 

but at some point 
I would recall 
instead I will drive down the road 
and
I will stand by the generator and I will look at the gauge 
</p>
<p>

in the trees 
it is pointless to consider 
that there is no relevant meaning 

when the toast has reverted back to bread 
the loaf will un-slice itself 
and return to the bag –– protected by the clip 

there was no disposition 
in the womb 
or on the coast 

and there they are 
after all the years 


in the cold lake water 
they are merely dirt in the foam 
</p>
<p>
an umbilical chord floating aimlessly 
the truck was in a ditch
a trail of pylons led towards the lake 
the pylons under the cloud shadow 

along the rocks and dirt 
into the water 

the truck 
the pylons 
the lake 

the sun has become white 
the truck is a bacteria 
like the moss on the rock 


I have spoken on the phone 
to someone 
and I am wondering if I can have a discounted rate 
apparently it isn't a possibility and I am wondering why 

I tried to explain this to the man 
who I spoke on the phone with 
but he didn't understand 
and neither did his manager 

so here I am 
considering it
while I stand in the grass

I will call the shop again 
when they open tomorrow 
and rephrase my question 
and hopefully in the end I will get it 

I was talking to people 
and now I am unsure if I will get it 

I will consider what has happened 
</p>
<p> 
I have seen the way the pylons are stacked beside the truck 
and the truck is parked in the driveway 

and Mouse will sniff the mud on the boots that sit by the door 
to get a sense of where I have been 
for all of that time 


to enjoy 
a drink of water

I will consider what purpose things have 
as to what is necessary 
and what is utter nonsense 


and who is simply a bastard 
a hedonist 
dead on the highway 
he lay along the asphalt 
imprinted by the truck tire

I will not go over 
instead I will take what I need from this tree stump 

</p>
<p>
I have known a truck driver
and he is not dead 
he is still driving every day 

into the dirt lot 
the lift gate closed and there was a generator inside of the outhouse 
rattling the thing 
and causing the sky to jitter 

the stars were callous and reconfiguring their alignment 
and none of the trucks could get through 
into the dirt lot 

it was redundant 
and idiotic 
and inefficient 
and many of the people explained that if they were in charge 
they would never have stored the generator in the outhouse 
and left the outhouse under the lift gate 

</p>

<p>

there is a man 
watching the sun 
it causes him to squint 

he waited there all night 
but he did not see the sun again 

he walked home 
defeated 

and went to bed 
and stared at the ceiling 

he would always remember the sun
that he saw 
</p>

<p>

the truck drove into the field 
the door swung open 
the river stepped out onto the grass
stepping along the heat and the mosquitoes 
and the quiet 
he would walk along to the road 
to get a wider view 

he steered the truck
aiming it towards the bottom of the hill 

and with his arm 
pushing against the lift  
towards the river
chasing after the truck and narrowly climbing into it

the truck down the hill 
the air through a crack in the windshield 

he forgot his past 
and rotted his core 

<br>
and in the morning he would go to the sun 
under the lamp 
its ability to burn 

it is unclear what it is wisdom 
and what is coddling uncertainty 
and what is rationalizing what is 

it is obvious 
that is the skill 
to have learned

it is obvious 
that the opposite is pointless 
 
</p>

<p>

across the hill 
there is grass 
and the air is sent into the sky 
past the cloud 
exhausted 
into the vacuum 
from very far away 
they look towards it from the valley  
to hide instead of to die
in the water 
its hubris and ego are uninteresting 

</p>
<p>

as a young child I remember writing on my computer and in my notebooks 
I wrote things like I am writing now, things that calmed me down and inspired me and helped me understand who I was 

I drew cartoons and I enjoyed that 
but it was always someone else’s game 

I loved to play guitar 
but I had a hard time memorizing songs and I didn’t like relying so much on all the gadgets

I loved making movies
but there was too much compromise

I loved people 
but I couldn’t depend on them like I could this 

I haven’t made much money off of writing in my life 
and I’m not sure many people have really read my stories at the end of the day 

but I am thankful to have written in this book 
and perhaps this will be the extent of my efforts 

I will continue to reckon with that 
and I will write again tomorrow 
writing has always proved to be difficult 
I’ve grown tired of the abstract for the most part 

I’m not sure I have the strength to quit 

</p>
<p>
to read the words on the page and not understand any of them 
the inability to focus 
the mind can move too quickly 
and wander too far in too many directions
perhaps I could use a nap 

the hubris and the greed of reading 
I would like to slow my thoughts down 
to understand things better to forgo any overarching message

</p>
<p>
my legs sunburnt 
I limped around 
we looked for rocks and sticks on the beach 

continuing onward 
an ordinary moment in the sun

today 
I wonbut the next time I am forsaken to whatever unrelenting hell awaits

I got two new pairs of slippers that were a good price
and I have been occupied with changing them back and forth 

deciding which is best

I can imagine an afternoon of wearing slippers 
as being a horrendous waste of time 

but I can also imagine an afternoon of wearing slippers
as being the privilege of my life 

a moment of shallow happiness <br>
and banal contentment to recall 
<br>
when she was at the eye doctor
I asked her mother 
if she knew her daughter's ring size

and at the store there were watermelons on sale 
and we bought one 
to bring to her mother 

her mother had set her collections of rings out onto the table 
and said that she was trying them on 
to get them fixed

she found the one that fit 
and when she wasn't looking 
her mother measured the ring with a piece of floss 

I traded her mother 
the watermelon 
for the floss 

and the next day 
I went to the ring shop
and bought one with diamonds in it 

and then we went into a boat 
and paddled along the water 
for the entire afternoon 

and at the end of the day 
my legs were burnt by the sun 

and I could hardly walk for two weeks
and I sat and considered 
when I would give the ring to her 
</p>
<p>
we drove 
until the end 
and there were rocks and water 

and when I gave her the ring 
she thought I was falling over
because I was kneeling in a strange way 

she said that she would take the ring
and we decided we would be married 
in the springtime 

she said that she knew there was something strange
about the watermelon 


</p>


<p>
my cat yawns 
and I can see all his teeth 

he will snug into his chair 
and reach his paw outward 

I will pat him on the head and he will be happy and purr
and he will lick my hand 

until he changes his mind and snaps his teeth 
and gives me a bite 

he likes to fight and wrestle 
and get into any trouble he can find 

sometimes he stalks into my office and meows 
and is looking to sit on my lap 

and other times he runs around the house 
like a bandit 

he loves cooking 
and smelling the spices and flavours 

he watches intently 
and we have made many great dishes together 

I will always love to see my cat 
and I am happy when he is happy 

</p>

<p>one of the great meals of my life

down the street 
along the concrete 
and there were many people outside 

I did not care 

</p>

last night
I had no idea what I was doing
going back between the two 
and seeing what happens 

a box of salt 
on sale 
and I did not intend to buy a box of salt 

the sun beats down on the curb 
one great win  

I seem to have a disinterest at the moment 
I imagine this is due to becoming engaged 
and the birth of my nephew 

yesterday was his bris 
my father held him 
and I held my sister's dog 

</p>
<p>
we saw haystacks 
and a cloud had drifted into the parking lot 
and went into the discount store 
where we looked at clothes 

a writer doing thoughts 
from a chair at home 
or sitting in an airport 

it is difficult at times 
I think it is difficult

I am faced with some deep rooted panic 
that I thought was of good quality 

but it washed off in the lake 


I became distracted 
and I imagined that rocks had fallen into the water 
and there was no salt 
I listened to the sound 
and it was not the salt or the ocean 


it is impossible 
in its glory 

how to return 
I saw the grass 
when I returned 
and the air reminded me of being away 

this is where I will be 
until I return

</p>

<p>

some pages
write new ones 

</p>
<p>

my poor cat 
if he was stuck out in the wild 

I hope he would be able to hunt
and eat on his own 

without someone pouring him cat food
every time he meowed 

I hope he would 
hunt 

</p>

<p>towards the road 
it is obvious but one explanation is that the mule came and saw it and ate it off the ground <br>
it didn't land on the ground beside him 
or on his head 
you can tell by his tracks in the dirt

</p> 
<p>
the wind made the trees move and the sun had disappeared
the sky was odd 
it entered into the parking lot and circled around and then left 

there were few people standing and something was going on there 
there were no more cars that entered the parking lot but the one that was there already 

the wind stopped and the trees became still and the sky had become much darker and it was night

the car remained and a person paced around and spoke on their cell phone 


</p>

the sky <br>
a commemorative plaque

but most people did not care about it 
and they did not stop to read the plaque 

the man who built the plaque was not very proud of that plaque

the last thing he was going to be thinking about in his dying days 
was a dumb plaque he made 

but it was the end of his life and he did begin to think of the last things he was going to think about 
and it was strange to think about the plaque again

and
he became proud of it 

and before he died he told his family about it 
and they decided they would visit the plaque one day 

perhaps after he died 
so that they could remember him 

</p>

over the years 
I can always remember a concern  
since I had to speak in front of the class at age of four 
we had to say what we ate for breakfast 
but I was too shy to say 

so instead my friend had to tell the class on my behalf
<br>it is possible that this experience defined my life

</p>
<p>

the salt, a mound of salt
it looked like a truck was buried beneath it 

and I asked the guy there
if there was a truck inside of the salt mound
and he said no there is no truck  

</p>
a shipping container full of salt had dropped off of the boat
it creaked off the edge and it opened and formed a random constellation 

a boy walked towards the shipping container and looked inside 
he looked at the walls and saw that the salt had clustered and hardened 

he thought of his sorrow and his dreams 
the days continued 
and he brought people to walk along 

and the grass grew 
and became very tall 
and the people became lost in it 

the small rain was on the grass

it was difficult to know the difference between the salt
a formation had floated from the container
there was a leak in the ceiling and nobody moved 

the shipping container is totally empty 

I will stand in a pair of socks that have holes in the heels 
these were great socks

but must they be discarded 

</p>







<p>
and Miriam came into my office 
and I said yes I was thinking the same thing 
the thoughts weren't entirely identical, but they were similar 

and maybe now I will drink some water
I have remembered I have been sitting at my desk 


</p>
<p>
I had spent some time today 


there was some time where I used to think I thought that 
I remember thinking I saw her

I remember her 
</p>

<p>




writing can be like that 
this morning 

I was a dirt

but in the evening I was happy about that 

who is anyone to tell you that 
<br>
along and
towards the sun
<br>

as far as I had ever walked

and the sidewalk began to seem vertical 
the sky 
towards a cloud 

eating supper 

someone screamed 

and one of the guys who was eating looked up
his wife and some of their cousins 
looked like he had turned into dog faced glass 

they said that he was a second from getting totally forgotten

</p><p>
some kids were in the field under the tree on the other side 

the kid had some kind of string or stick and he was using it to whip a cardboard box and the other kids stared at him 

eventually one of them came back with half a concrete block and tossed it at the box



the kid with the stick kept whipping the cardboard box 
and the others stood there, with their bikes 

<br>upward
the yolk as the sun
and the egg in the sink
and I thought of the yolk as the sun 

I spoke to a child who had a blade in his hand
and I asked him what happened to the stick 

he said he felt that the bad thoughts had stepped over the good 
and I understood what he meant 

I spoke to the child about his computer
knowing I would never see his face or speak to him again 
<br>
there was the egg in the sink 
and I thought of the yolk as the sun 

and the blade pierced into the yolk 
and the yolk dissipated into light 

and I looked closer at the ceiling and the sky and 
there was a patch mark in a place I hadn't noticed before

I lay on the couch looking at the sky 
and thinking of the hole above my head

<br> I got up on a chair 
and pushed on the part that was patched over

and eventually I pulled it 

right above where the couch was
it is a damn slow form 
<br>
I was supposed to have written my name  
and I don't know why I did that 

</p>

a mule walked from the road 
it saw water and drank it 
and continued walking
until it was away <br>
where there was grass <br>
I think it brought me happiness 

I have since wrote many similar thoughts 
and accumulated a lot of happiness from it all 

I am reflecting on that 
and feeling both good and ashamed 

I will consider that for a moment 
the view of this hole,
the tree
grown and seen the inside of the hole 
and
there was no hole 
it was only the view of a hole 

and dirt and grass 
<br>
and the green square became a computer 
in the end 

the truck driver drove in the fog 
no one would have any damn idea
the headlights of the truck cut through the fog

the truck driver left the truck


that is when he saw the young kid
waving a blade 


there were pylons on the road
<br>
strangely ordinary 

<br>
the road ended

he knew how bad things could go 
he knew what could happen 
but he still went in the dust 
he wasn't going to stop this truck 
and turn around 
as through hell 
find some other route 
 
he couldn't deal with nothing</p>
<p>

the people deleted me 
and I become upset 

it did not collect the dust that was between the floorboard and the panel in the corner of the room

the dust in itself 
inside of it, the lamp is its sun and when it is turned off it becomes nighttime 

I would say that there is no dust 
but probably inside the dust they have argued over their versions 
and it has been a whole ordeal 
<br>
they will be grateful to return home when they do 
<br>
they will explain a sheer awe  
they will have seen the capacity of their faith in what is unknown to them 
<br>
I will continue to wonder what else has happened there </p>
<p>
I noticed a cut on his elbow and I did not ask him where he got it
I forgot to ask him 
</p>
<p>
with the sun
it went on for a week until the shadow of the rubble rotated with the sun 

I remembered that my friend 
stood in the shadow of the cut around his elbow with the sun 

I know that he had the cut before <br>
but I couldn't help but wonder if it had stayed there for a long time 
<br>
I yawned
and eventually I took a nap 

and when I woke up from the nap 
there was clear packaging on the ground 

the man saw it and looked at it 
he did not want to pick it up
so he put it into the garbage can 
instead of the recycling bin 

his brother had left that morning from the convenience store 
and it was difficult to say goodbye 
he told him to wait until the place was empty 
and 
he begged his brother not to  
but he knew that wasn't the point 

there was no changing his brother's mind 
he had known that for a long time 
so he told him he should stand next to the slurpee machine 
it would be like when they were kids 
and he saw how many flavours they could mix into the cup
and he got a laugh from his brother 
and maybe that was the best he could do 

later that day 
when he saw the packaging on the ground
he felt hesitant to pick it up
but he still did 
he just didn't have the heart to recycle it 
so instead he put it in the trash can 
it was the best he could do 

</p>
<p>on top of the truck 
it was a small 
awareness <br>

when the man arrived home the dog was waiting for him by the door 
and it barked through the window
<br>
it was the man <br>
who was the bastard 

</p>
<p>
the sound of it was like a chirp that could be bought at a tourist shop 

that someone dumped out onto the road </p>

and the gutter meant in such a way 
that it did 
and I asked around but I couldn't get a straight answer out of anyone 

and that was a damn shame 
because I thought that I would like to know how to open the door in such a way 

in the pond dust <br>
in the pond in the road 
<br>

someone capped it as finished 
but there was no survey of the road 

or the pond 
form the wind
from the tire squeal 
it was a hellish creature 
that travelled through the tar of the asphalt 

it was a fellow 
who often travelled beneath the mud and to hell 
and back again, for work, it was his daily commute 
</p><p>
a styrofoam cup 
turned the styrofoam cup to ash 
<br>
those ashes were swept into another styrofoam cup
and then that cup of ashes were put into another cup 
this happened many times 

until there was a styrofoam cup that was filled to the brim 
<br>
the cup sat on the mantle and people came to look at it

they had no interest in it 
they saw it and thought that it was frivolous and

in the evening I was facing a depression 
at the thought <br>

and I have become devastated <br>
and inconsolable 
<br>
to see what they have to say about the scenario

the last time we spoke they were wise 
</p>
<p>
I hope they did not go to talk to my friend to see what he has to say 

I don't know if I've ever introduced my friend 
but I think they would get along well 
<br>
that will have to be what I do tomorrow <br>
I think it will be a good one <br>yes
</p>
<p>
I have been in a negative state <br>
it is my default mindset 
<br>

I don't know if I'll ever be able to let go the idea that I am destined to fail 
I understand the idea that imagining failure will lead to exactly that 
<br>
I really do like it 

</p>
<p>
I will edit a few more times and then trying not to spite what I wrote earlier about my negative state 
but I could see how people will try and I will have no idea about anything
</p>
<p> 
still I was hoping to have opened the window today 
but I did not get around to it 

I will have to go into the bed
and put my head onto the pillow 

I will close my eyes and eventually I will fall asleep 
and when I am sleeping I will have no idea about anything 

I will wake up and I will go to the window 
and I will open the window 

and I will see what is going on 
</p>


<p>

outside the window 
it is dark and quite frightening if I am being honest 

when I was young I used to extend the dirt as far as it would go
I would release it and then run as it snapped shut 

I have a tape measurer here 
in the dirt 
<br>
he ate an entire chicken, uncooked, still living 

that chicken was just walking along the path 
going along with his eggs 
<br>

I couldn't believe it 
<br>

but it doesn't matter 
what thoughts have been forgotten when it is melted into the sun 

and
has overtaken the keyboard 


some of their heads went melting into the sun 
<br>
what thoughts had been forgotten 
and melted into the sun 

we will find out 
<br>the sun is heat and in the end I knew what I was talking about 
and I knew what I was doing 

so I will suggest to make sure no one will cause you any grievance 
by default 
without even trying
</p>
<p>


I may have spoke too soon<br> 
the complication arose again and  

it is horrendous waste of time 
and this ongoing instance of total idiocy has lost me hours 
<br>
it is futile to have become as angry as I am 
but the feeling remains for the time being 

I would prefer to write in peace 
then have to deal with these perverse infidels 

I will have to let it go 
and stillcuriously I have triumphed 


and this is for the reason that I have written in such a way that I am extremely pleased 

it is a story about a man who sees a boy holding a blade in the rode and 
I think it is the best I have ever written 

when I read it over and made my edits 
I had some good laughs and enjoyed it all quite a bit 

there is one scene of gratuitous violence that I may feel the need to change
and maybe something about the final page 

but it is okay 
and I'll keep thinking about it 
but otherwise I think it will be a story for all
and I will look forward to seeing how it is 

</p>

<p> currently sitting in his hotel bed 
and reading a book 
and watching tv 
when it is time he will care
about his wedding

those bastards were in the hallway

he was in the grass
he had no idea how to get home 
he looked at the daylight moon 

maybe things weren't so bad at the hotel
with the tv 

maybe he could stay there from now on 
and make that his new home 

maybe that wouldn't be so bad 
so he returned back 

he walked slowly 
unsure of what was to come he continued down the road 
the wind carried the dirt as he walked

he stopped at a gas convenience store
he listened to the song on the radio that played 
and it made him feel calm

he walked along the road  
he searched everywhere for the hotel 
but it wasn't there 

</p>

<p>
he got into his truck and went out of the parking lot 
the sun had risen in the convenience store parking lot
the damaged ceiling 

people were talking about it 
the need to repair 
eventually the workers stood in the parking lot 

they discussed how to repair the damage 
and they drank coffee 

they tarped off the roof

they were still unsure 
how to fix the ceiling

eventually they realized everything was as alright as it was 

</p>

<p>
it was windy on the road and I walked by and looked at the ceiling
the roof was tarped off

</p>
six months passed 
under a concrete block 

a cell phone charger 
perhaps I will tape some cardboard overtop of it 
tomorrow 
when I woke up I went and
it had not changed 
I went up the street into a recycling bin 
and fished out a cardboard box 

I taped the box down and
when I returned
the cardboard was gone 
I didn't sleep well 

I stared at it for a long time 
and then I tried to get some more work done

and when I looked at it again 
it seems like there was no vanishing point down 

I returned and I felt a great irritation 

I swept dust
I kicked my chair
I walked for a long time 
eventually some dirt formed under my shoes 

I walked for a long time 

my feet were sore and I wanted to go home 
but I didn't know where I was going 
I kept walking 

it took a long time
to get home 

</p>
<p>

I had woken up this morning at about four thirty 
I drank my coffee and 
wrote back some emails

it is hard to be yourself 
it is hard to know yourself 

I burnt the lint off the sock 
there is a leaf below the radiator 
it is dried and covered in dust 

</p>
<p>
I was writing in my notebook 
and there were crumbs on the table

I wiped them off onto the ground 
and then I kept writing in my notebook 

and after I forgot I did that and stepped on the crumbs and made them go into the rug 

eventually the crumbs will become dust
and from there I do not know what will happen 

</p>
<p>
yarn 

there were veins knotted into a ball 
like yarn 
and someone was using them to sew a cardigan 
they sat in the middle of the street 

a few years later I saw a sweater at the thrift store
I saw a guy try it on and he seemed to like it 
he stared at himself in the mirror for a long time 
but in the end he put it back onto the rack 

</p>
<p>in the end  
he saw that there did not need to be anymore bloodshed

he got an ergonomic chair 
some were happy and others were not 

and then one day 
a box floated down the river 
the cardboard was really let down by that 
it floats in the air 
and there are no trees in the background 

just the grey sky 
after six weeks or longer
it moved like it was being dragged by a computer mouse 

it went towards a convenience store  
and there were no buildings in the background 
just the grey sky 
</p>
<p>

To write a ten thousand word version 
To write towards the sixty thousand word mark 

switching between <br>
and how relentless it is<br>

my ego <br>
its attempt to prove its worth <br>

I will look forward to forgetting this nonsense 
</p>
<p>


squandering away<br> there is no alleyway 
to beg for mercy 

to sit at my desk 

to work on my writing 
I drank my coffee 

I will enjoy a plate of scrambled eggs 
<br>
I remember one kid I grew up with 
his mom cooked scrambled eggs in the microwave 

</p>
<p>

both the glass from the windshield 
and the pain of glass 

the driver of the sedan 
took off his glasses 

to realize
his lenses had smashed too 

he did not blink for almost a minute 
after that 

</p>
<p>I walked outside of the house today 
and looked upward 
 
I looked at my ladder
and in the direction of the cloud 

a man returned after less than an hour 
with a bucket of paint 
and he painted the ceiling 

</p>
<p>
I sat at my desk 
and read my book 
and wrote down some things 

I remembered in that moment 
a time when I was walking through the grass 
and saw a small circular tupperware

both those things had happened
in the same place on the same day 

I am  writing something down 
about the book I am reading 

</p>

<p>
an empty sky
only three buildings 
and two billboards 

they were rectangles
there is snow on the roof next door

</p>
<p>

I bought a glass jar 
dumping coffee grinds in the jar

I will leave them there 
until it is almost full

and then I will take the grinds 
and dump them 

I will then wash out the jar 
</p>

<p>


my cat sleeps 
in the chair beside me 
<br>
tomorrow I am getting married 
<br>
originally we were going to get married in the spring 
but last week we decided
we would do it tomorrow instead
<br>
three years ago tomorrow we ordered chinese food
and she spent the night 
</p>

<p>
there is a blue clay pot in the basement 
my wife had inscribed her name into the bottom of it 
when she was ten or twelve or so 

she thought it was garbage 
but I wanted to keep it 
and use it as a pencil holder 
on my desk 

</p>
there was a guy I worked with 
who had raccoons living in his ceiling 
their piss dripped onto his sister when she was sleeping 

and eventually the drywall gave out 
and they fell onto her 
when she was working in her room 


I laughed when he told me about it
but he didn't find it funny at all 

</p>

<p>

I have spent the last few weeks making a candle from my earwax 
I plan to light it tomorrow morning when I wake up

I don't know why I made the candle
or why I chose tomorrow as the day to light it

I am worried that my wife 
will become angry when she realizes what I've been up to all of this time 

sitting in my office
</p>

<p>
<center>2022</center>
</p>
<p>

the sky 
became yellow and orange and pink and then black 

it was like someone had wrapped the earth 
in a trash bag 

we could not see anything
if not for the little holes in the trash bag

where the sun poked through 

still there was not enough light to see
</p>

<p>
at some point last year 
he dragged the salt around the shop
there was wind outside
</p>

<p>
we made sandwiches for dinner
and I cleaned the dishes afterward 

I am a thirty four year old man 
today I wrote in my notebook 

tomorrow I will wake up 
and begin writing again 

I do not know where my misery has gone to 
it may have fallen out of my pocket and into the street
or perhaps it went in with the wind 
</p>


dust and a rock on the other 
the cloud
where people were walking 
if it was the cloud's fault 
they have clattered broken into pieces 
and there is salt in them 
a lit earwax candle 

filling the glass cup 
with water 

and putting it on my desk 
taking a sip every now and again 

as I spend time in writing things down
and considering what I have written 

and sit in my chair 
trying to remember  a box of envelopes that were floating 
inside of a cloud 
<br>
the envelopes were never used 
it was decided that they were bought last year 
they were still perfectly fine 
but no one could ever use those envelopes
not when they were found floating inside of that cloud
in the center of the room 
it hangs in the air 
like someone has drawn it with a pencil 
I threw a box at it 
and now the box floats with it

I do not know what the point of the box is 
but I am glad to have found a use for that box

it was just this box that was sitting in the hall for a long time 
and for some reason I didn't want to toss it out </p>

<p>

toast crust 
goes onto the plate 

they are crumbs 
they are the crumbs 

I love watching that video
with the crumbs 

I sat down originally and 
I thought of its relevance 

it is something that is strongly felt 
it is a tree branch that is never deleted 

I am scared to think of a new website 
http://www.joshuahillelbarsky.com 

I have realized it is satanic in a way 

my first name has six letters
my middle name has six letters
my last name has six letters 

but I am not the devil 
I am more like the poodle 
from faust 
</p>

<p>

that was the severity of his denial 
he did not know if he should even tell himself 

and that is what he said to his friend 
he said that he couldn't believe it 

and his friend did not understand what he meant 
it was on his face 
</p>

<p>
a pattern of honest leaving 
still I have ended up returning to my desk 
climbing in the snow you can see the cat 
sleeping by the fireplace 

</p>
<p>
to slow my thoughts down <br>
enough to think them 

shovelling snow off the roof 
onto an old woman's head 

I looked for her body 
but I didn't find it 

I forgot to mention that there was a blank envelope on my desk
</p>
<p>

I pulled the fridge from the wall and I became lost in insulation 
<br>
the bowls now 
serve as a memorial 
</p>
<p>

I ended up napping in my chair 
while I was reading 

reading over what I wrote
I became filled with self doubt 

a computer keyboard 
stuck out of a mound of snow 

thrown into the air like a bone 
it smashed on the ground 
and his friend jumped onto it and he slid on it down the hill 

his friend laughed
and they left it at the bottom of the hill 

it froze into place overnight 
and in the morning another kid saw it

he kicked it 
and it snapped in half 

half of it went into the middle of the road
and the other half remained frozen in the snowbank 

a car drove by and ran over the half that was in the middle of the road  

one day the snow will melt and the half that was frozen in the snow bank 
will be there
</p>

<p>
I used to know a guy that 
had an elastic band on his foot 
he's dead now 
he was having a heart attack
and then fell into an elevator shaft


I didn't feel much when I heard he was dead
my friend had called and told me 
sometimes people die and it is just what happened 

but still I think about that guy a lot 
I once saw a dog try to bite him 
I laughed my ass off when I saw that 
</p>
<p>


a few days ago I felt like having a haircut
but then I changed my mind 

things have mostly returned to normal 
since then 
</p>

<p>

I was sitting and reading a book 

in the back seat of the car and there was no one driving the car
<br>
just a cement block strapped to the steering wheel 

I am facing somewhat of a sadness

it is strange to be under the stamp 
to be an ink pad 

<br>
the walls of the room become smaller 

I will drink my water now 
and forget my thoughts
for the most part 

it is strange to face a sadness 
that has no clear explanation for being 

An ongoing exhaustion that has no clear explanation for being 


I'm sure you understand what I mean 
I found a container in my room 
there was gasoline in the mop bucket
and someone tossed a match in it 
and then the mop bucket fell down the stairs 

</p>

onwards into the grass
and he went on his computer and was trying to save his file 

but it wasn't working properly 

he sat in the grass and began to scream
because all of his work was not saved 

he had a hard time explaining 
because of how upset he was

but the other side of himself was very patient and listened to him 
and eventually went on the computer 

and figured out what was going wrong with the file 
and found out where it was being saved 
</p>
<p>
I think of the people I know 
who have died
<br>
it is real light 
<br>
</p>

<p>


I returned
and thought of something else in that moment 

I have faced what it is lately 
in my own way 

I will have to accept that it may always be there
in some form

perhaps the next time it arrives
I could remember that, and not feel so affected by it 

but that is the problem 
with it 

is that it forces a person into a moment 
and it is difficult 
to be my own ally 
and against myself simultaneously 
</p>

<p>
I'm going to give him the middle finger 

that did nothing 
it was slightly opaque at best 
he blared his windshield wiper fluid
even though his windshield wasn't dirty 
because he loved how it made it look like it was raining 

I forgot 
I almost got so bored 
that I was going to leave

</p>
<p>

I have no suggestion
unless there is something to be said 
that I’m unaware of 

there may be a certain thing 
in my stomach 

that I would like to isolate
it is a consistent 

and low level panic 
of sorts 

when I woke up in the night 
at three in the morning or so 
I read my book for one hour or so 
and then my wife came and told me to sleep again 
</p>

<p>
provincial dirt


yesterday 

I heard a strange squeaking in the tree
my wife said it was someone's furniture 

but I thought it was a bird 
and today when I was walking in the same spot 

I heard it again 
that same noise 

I looked down to the dirt
it looked store bought 

not provincial dirt 

</p>
<p>

still unbothered 
some guy sat there 

I asked him what the hell was going on
but he was dead 

so I left 
I realized then that the igloo
but it was too late

and a horse's tooth 

only then 
will anyone have the slightest chance 

to know
what the hell is going on 
most people have no idea 
I will think more 
about the pothole dream

the pothole was in the road
and it was full of rainwater

I was looking at it from the window 
when I woke up I realized I couldn't see the pothole from the window
and I was only dreaming I could 

when I walked to the car afterward 
I saw the pothole, as I knew it to be 


some woman who was tanning in her bathing suit saw it 
sent from hell 

worse than asphalt
but at least there was no longer a dollar store cheese grater 
floating around 
in the water 
</p>


<p>


metal is shattered 
there in the field 

the metal 
is dumb and infertile 

and I can assure you 
in their capacity 
to suffer 

I will say this 
for what it's worth 

I have followed a piece of advice in this endeavour 
to be patient & persistent 

I will say that from typing out these thoughts 
it is better 

</p>

<p>

I really respected him 
he was a kind person 

it took me some time to realize 
I was walking down the sidewalk 
when I saw 

that the guy with the big ears 
was none other 

than 
me

I saw myself in the reflection of 
a puddle 

and 
I couldn’t even remember when it had rained 

even though I had been out walking 
for almost two hours 

I have been relaxing in my chair for one hour or so 
considering tinnitus 

now that the snow has melted
and the sun has been warmer

I have been considering getting a new pair of sneakers 
I went online and saw some different styles 

usually I have black sneakers 
but I began thinking of getting blue ones 

I saw ones that were blue and had an orange stripe on them
and another pair that were similar but instead had a yellow stripe

I thought the ones with the yellow stripe 
looked a bit better 

both looked as good quality of any sneaker out there

I am not sure if I will buy a new pair of sneakers in the end
the truth is I still like the ones I already have 

I will consider it further
over the next few days </p>

<p>

there was a guy that transformed into a bucket of drywall composite 
and one day I was walking across the room 
how that guy looked now
as a bucket of drywall composite 

I knew him from before
we actually went to the same elementary school 

</p>

<p>


and get 
sucked into the vent
and trapped in the air duct?

a lot of people have been speaking about this 
lately 

I have stumbled upon a recent memory of a wet twig on the sidewalk 
I kicked it and it got caught in the heel of my new shoe before rolling off into the gutter
<br>
consider becoming a twig 

I am not so resilient 
but still I will hope to become a twig at some point in my life
unless I have become one already 

in that case I will have to take the time to understand 
that my purpose has been fulfilled 

</p>

<p>
there is a certain dread
and a quiet, chronic panic 

it has something to do with doing all things imperfectly 
or doing all things perfectly 

there is something in me that seems to feel the need to grasp onto some overarching method 
that could become definitive of myself 

like a doorknob 
acting as a wheel on the car 

</br>
it is strange to say things in front of a group of people 
sometimes it’s a terrible feeling 
and other times it can go okay

I would say that I have slowly gotten better at it 
over the years 
but I still get anxious whenever I have to do it

one of the difficulties 
is knowing what the hell you’re 
even saying 

sometimes I think I know what I’m saying 
but when I speak in front of a group of people 
I realize that I don’t 

</p>
<p>
I was standing around
considering things 

when my wife came 
into the room 

</p>

<p>
after I went to the garage 
the sun went into a small cardboard box
and some guy duct taped it closed

I watched him eat a woman whole 
including her shopping cart 

on the asphalt 
and then back to the field 

he thought to himself 
that who he was, was not who he had become, 
it was who he had always been 

today 
he just wanted to stand 
and he was not surprised the he was becoming quite bored 
of standing around

I forget his name 
and I don't remember what he looks like or much about him

I think we were in the same elementary school
or something

I just got a message and apparently 
the man is dead now 
and there was nothing anyone could do to save him

I intend to visit his grave one day, 
I'm not sure how I will find it

since I can't even remember 
his name

</p>
<p>


it became night 
he awoke at one point 
in the morning 
the sun and the sky 
for many days
returning
it continued 
and in the convenience store
he left and walked down the street
and the sun was hot on his face
and he rolled up the sleeves of his jacket
and undid one of the buttons of his shirt 

a jawbone wedged into the wheel of his truck 
he noticed it was there when he was getting fuel 
and a cold drink

he yanked the jawbone out of the tire and looked at the teeth 
he hosed off the teeth and peeled off the flesh with his knife 

as he drove he couldn't stop thinking about it
so he turned his truck around 

it was nighttime 
and he walked around the road with a flashlight 
looking 

there were no other trucks on the road 
eventually he got back into the truck
and he checked in to a hotel 
he watched tv for some time 

until he went to the ice machine 
and he got some ice for the soda he bought earlier 

and he sat on the porch there and looked out at the road 
and stared off and he didn't sleep at all
</p>


<p>

the tooth reupholstered 
in gratuity 
it is sad to think but it is inevitable 

do not consider it
unless you are willing to 

you can call it revenge 
you can call it hell  
nothing
could be used for the rock 

the tire 
rolled down the road 

get your vehicle destroyed
towards the daytime moon 
the new bylaw 
dismembered itself 
in protest 
it was a righteous choice
by any account
but still 
it did not cause the bylaw to fail

he is a man of dignity 
and integrity 

whether he realizes it 
or not


he walks through a field 
and many firecrackers are exploding above him

the clouds are filling with strange lights

he is in the elevator 
going upward

he is walking down the hallway along the rug
there is dust on the rug 

he walks around the hallway aimlessly for almost two hours
before entering the elevator again 

he leaves through the lobby
and walks down the street, admiring the fireworks

for their persistence 
and he goes back to the room and watches the television

there are commercials playing 
they are louder than the fireworks

but the fuel that had soaked into him from the gas station 
but in the distance they color the smoke 

a black ominous cloud filled with strange light 
the semantics of a peculiar notion 
have revealed themselves
in the silhouette among the trees 

it has been said
that the task
has solely to do 
with what most would be too ashamed to notice

a group of trees
are flaming 
on the cliffside
they are falling 
towards their doom 

they have taken the shape of the silhouette
as they burn and fall 
towards the dirt below 

it was sad and pitiful to see them burn 
but regardless of the fire 
instead 
of taking the usual way 
he saw one of his friends, a guy from elementary school 
walk through a band saw
right through the eye of the blade

and he did not go to his friend's funeral 
because he forgot 
and he has not taken the time to go to his tombstone
because he cannot remember his friend's name 

he is looking for his reflection in the road 
imagining a band saw blade coming towards him
and he was fearful 

his friend on the other hand 
simply walked into the blade
perhaps by idiocy or by choice 

and then he went back and watched tv until he slept 

and he awoke in the morning 
and eyeballed the sun
until it became the moon again 
and 
he considered his friend 
perhaps his friend 
died well 
he thought 

perhaps he died well 

</p>
<p>

look at that twig 
floating 
above the cement 

look at that twig
floating
towards the dirt 

I have followed it for almost two weeks
towards the city landfill 
and past the city landfill

through the forest
and finally 
it stabbed a bee's nest 

and it took the bee's nest 
back out of the woods
and towards the city 
<br>
look at that bee's nest 
floating 
away from the forest 

look at the bee's nest
floating 
towards the city 

I was stung for the first time 
when I reached over and pressed the automatic door open button 

the bee's nest 
is there

it waits there 
steadily 
buzzing

the twig hive 

it has no purpose 
it has no thoughts
or reason 

it has ground 
each pillar
to evaporated salt
and 
it has ground 
each pillar
to evaporated salt dust mites

from there
there's no telling what will happen 
we will never know
why the stick floated that bee hive from the woods

the quest has been profane 
for obvious reasons

there was nothing more to be said 
because of that

even those who could never stop talking 
had nothing to say at that point
about the worm soul of the motorized birth

it did not die well 
he was a fool

he was not killed well

some call him nothing at all

if you mention the cavernous scab
I would consider a box of paper
know that it will dwindle in the horizon

and there will be no rescue 
for those who inevitably will heal 
it is time to consider nothing
carefully vacuuming the milk 


the drywall
has become 
an infamous pastime 

a mirror spins down the hallway 
and if there is no reflection 

to notice in the water
I would say to find another fountain

otherwise 
there is little to consider 
and it is time to consider nothing 
sacrificing worm excrement 
the cat claws the worm
and flings it towards the sun 

I am sitting in a chair 

holding a can opener and thinking of ground worm 

it was not water
they have found nothing but hot metal 

and they may not return again 


the wheelbarrow falls over
onto its side 

and rolls down the hill
making two lines in the grass

how will it be destroyed
when it hits the rocks below

</p>

<p>

and walked across the grass
until there was no grass
and only dirt 

an envelope 
arrived 
 
it was in some dirt 

it may not seem likely 
but I'm not sure what to tell you
I wouldn't make up a lie for no good reason 

what use would all of this be
if it was all senseless nonsense 

who would dare
defile the pursuit of truth 

all of that integrity 
wasted 

gasoline 
senselessly 
dousing the flame 

there is no wisdom 

the blade cuts in two simultaneous directions
both indistinguishable from one another 

it is difficult to know 
noticing the rocks 
and the dirt 

the more I think about it 
the more I realize 

a twig
has broken off the tree 

and 
looking upward at the damage 

seeing the cloud floating 

the one the lightning came from 
the one that has been lingering for many days 

a strange thing outside the window
a women wearing yellow dish gloves
standing on the roof of her house and cleaning a satellite dish 

I don't know what purpose that would serve 

growing up my friend from elementary school had a satellite dish 
I can't remember his name 
but I couldn't believe how many channels were on that thing 
movies that had barely just got out of theatres 

meanwhile 
I was standing in the yard 
sacrificing cattle 

trying to get a signal 
</p>
<p>


and to think
merely days ago 
I was sitting in my chair 

I suppose tomorrow
I will wake up 
and drink my coffee 

and try again 
to write  

and when the cloud goes near the sun
it will burn 
like the other clouds that have burned 
like lint 

it is 
the miserable worm hell 
of logic and ego

but still 

I will say that I am glad to have found this dictionary
in the neighbour's box 

it has been helpful
to have at my desk

even though I have never once opened it

</p>

<p>
I will sit at my desk 
and I will write 
<br>
a container 
a truck in the road 

<br>
I have not won an award in a long time 
if ever 
<br>
I can see their thinking 
I can see why they want to give me the award

likely I will win 
well

there is a chance 
but I don't know if I will win 

in fact
I can see now 

why I won't win 
yes

it's true
they just needed more people to nominate 

and they felt guilty 
since I had not been nominated me before

I don't think I will win
in fact

I'm sure of it
It will just end up being a distraction
and I don't have time to go to the ceremony 

so I will say thank you for the nomination 
consider this my acceptance speech 

and know that it will better to give the award 
to some other guy 

thank you
</p>

<p>
Walking along the road 
the sun was warm 
and there was some wind 

seeing the sun and watching it roast to hell

and walking along the road and looking towards writing again tomorrow 
when I sit 
doing nothing 

</p>

<p>
into oblivion 

if anyone realizes 
or not who he is 

he sits on the curb
you would be a fool 
if you didn't realize 

he was that guy I went to elementary school with
whose name I can't remember 

not the truck driver 
the guy from elementary school 

ask him if he is alright

I don't know
maybe I'll just keep it to myself 
I'm tired 

maybe I'll go over tomorrow
or in the next couple days

</p>
<p>

I was looking at a website 
I think my chair was positioned 
in a way you couldn't see 

what the hell is this  
a cloud going along 

it was narrowly a bastard 
for no reason

if you've ever seen a rock for the hell of it 
you'll know what I'm talking about

especially to those enjoying 
a cold drink

maybe from the convenience store 
but alas 

he dumped the drink onto the table
and he showed us that it was unable to rot 

it had been butchered in such a way
that it was unable to rot 

it was a curious thing
seeing that rank plastic with a hole in it 

leaking off the table 
and onto the ground 

that vengeful bastard
with no remorse 
the ice cubes melt 
turning the dirt into mud

the mud
is wet dirt 

and that 
is what there is to know 

but you have to trust me 
there is nothing else to know about it 

I'm sorry if you were expecting more 
I'm sorry if you thought there was some joy there

or some sadness 
or some interest 

but truly it is that banal 
I cannot apologize for that 

I cannot apologize for the mud 
I cannot apologize for the dirt 

but I suppose if I am honest 
I can apologize 

for dumping that cold drink onto the dirt 
and turning it into mud 

genuinely 
I can apologize for that

I only did it out of spite 
I only did it to turn the dirt into mud 
</p>
<p>

a small cardboard box  
to upend a notorious reputation in the business

but they are severe amateurs 
canisters of unbridled ambition 
empty jerry cans

they have charged a low rate
and there was a promotion code

that's the extent of it 
that's where we're at right now 

regardless it's causing a lot of trouble 
the gnats will hit the road

a person has got to get the soap out
and get the damn place clean 

you cannot answer the phone
you must think your thoughts 


</p>

<p>


in relation to who he once was 

he would overcome that 

but 
no one ever heard from him
again 

money included 
even a melted tire
included in this

even a melted tire 
knows the cowardice


but he was always able to keep his spirits up 
even when things seemed like they were going rough for him

</p>
<p>

I was trying to read my book
in the parking lot 
I thought it is possible that that guy from my elementary school 
truly has no name 
<br>
sitting on the subway 
and reading my book 

some coffee left in my cup
and trying to settle 

it is strange to be among people 
it is strange to look around the street and see people doing whatever they are doing 

eating my sandwich
and standing on the sidewalk

and still drinking my coffee
and looking around the street again at all of the people 
</p>
<p>
I was here once before 
and another time before that 

and now here I am 
again 

it is a general sentiment 
towards nothing 

aside from time 
passed

and what has happened 
since 

I suppose if I got here
I can keep going 

I will see what is coming 
next </p>
<p>

a dust nap 
there was peaceful time lurking around that air conditioner 
so when it broke 
I became a sad 

but I trashed it 
<br>
I didn't think I'd ever see it again 

but then one day 
I was walking down the side of the road
and there it was 

floating above the grass 

I went back a few days later 
and it was gone 
but at least I got to see it one last time 
</p>

it was sad in a way 
but in another way, I felt nothing 

</p>
<p>
It happens 
that sometimes 
my cat and I yawn 
simultaneously 

we’re exhausted
and now it’s time to relax 

we’re going to eat some snacks
and watch tv

</p>
<p>floated  
narrowly by a truck 

a cloud 

<br>
if 
I sit here 

drinking my water

perhaps 
I'm unsure at the moment 

that I accidentally became
wake foam 
like a vice grip 
holding two pieces of bread together 

but I am feeling better
here in my office 

with this fridge water 

it has been four days 
already 

</p>
<p>
who is the damn bastard 
with the hand mixer 
and the glue trap 
if he was careful... 

but that's life 
as they say 

a single toilet 
remains in the area 

</p>
<p>

I bought a new backpack 
today 

since the zipper on my old backpack 
broke

the straps are comfy 
on my shoulders

I got it for a good price

when I got home I tested it out 
I put all my stuff in 

my computer, books,
pens

there is room for all 
my stuff

and I think 
there will be room for my lunch also
</p>
<p>




someone left their purse
on a bench 

it sat there for days
getting rained on 
and getting stared at
and doing nothing 

until a kid came
and tossed it into the fountain
<br>
it floated in the water 

the strange shadow it cast 
slowly circling above the coins 

</p>

<p>

drinking water
and thinking about my old buddy Paul 

I laughed a lot more when he was alive 

rest in peace 
& godspeed 

miss you man 
and I'm sorry 

1987 -- 2019

</p>

<p>
drinking a cup of water 

writing in my notebook 
reading a book 
going for a walk 

scratching my cat’s head 
changing his water bowl 
giving him a spring to play with 

the rest is history 

</p>
<p>
I have to continue scrubbing these pots and pans 
there’s a lot of burnt stuff crusted on them 

afterward I will read my book 
I’m almost on chapter ten 


drinking water 
going on the computer
blinking 

sometimes becoming upset for long periods of time 

and other times dealing with a prolonged excitement
for no reason in particular that I can understand 

</p>
<p>

at night <br>
with the sun 

it seems that things are okay 
<br>
I finished reading my book 
<br>

the possibility
stands here 

a little sign in the dirt 

our lives are too inundated 
with quality and greatness 

how then can we 
compensate for our idiocy 
where do we go to see the unintelligible nonsense 
<br>

a container 
hidden under the stairs 

full of elbow fleece 
and crumbs 

I will be here 

<br>
I watched a tv show
for almost twelve hours 

I couldn’t stop until 
it was done 

it was a detective show 
and seemeed very realistic

a lot of bad things happened 
to everyone

it was not for the faint of heart

there were many brutal scenes 
including a close up of a surgery 

I had to look away 
while they packed the gauze 

as well as a scene where a guy’s arm got shot off
<br>
it has been so quiet 
all I can hear is tinnitus squeal 

<br>

I have been floating around 

yanking out my nose hairs 
and using them as commas 

living in the air 
tomorrow and right now 

<br>
some guy 
was standing on the sidewalk 
picking a rock out of the bottom of his shoe 

<br>

there was a cow 
in the field 

all of the other cows 
had went off somewhere 

but he 
stayed 

and he stared at the road 
not blinking 

every so often 
a truck would pass 

I had been at the convenience store
I bought a bag of chips 

I was eating them while walking down the road
I saw the cow 
in the field 

<br>
and now I am staring at an empty laundry basket
unable to remember the word I was thinking of 


<br>

usually he is sitting at his keyboard
testing shortcuts 

he has pressed command
and every letter

he is trying to find a function 
that no one has ever found before

most people who have met him 
hate him 

he wishes they didn't 
he cares deeply what others think 

but he does not know how to act
in a way that is redeemable or forgivable 

and so he sits at his keyboard 
trying to discover a function that no one has ever found 
before
 
for forgiveness 
for redemption 

<br>

he was found passed out 
next to a pylon 

it seemed that he was hit by some vehicle 
or another 

he is in the hospital now 
resting 

he hasn't said a word
since he's been there 

everyone has asked him what happened 
but he won't say 

the nurse 
said she was worried

that he was trying to get hit 
by the truck

and that he
was trying to end his life

I asked the nurse how she knew it was a truck 
and she said that she didn't know

I nodded 
and thought about what she said 

the truth was 
I had the same thought 

I knew he wouldn't usually go to the road 
for anything 

at times I think that if he wanted to get himself killed
then there would have been no stopping him 

and at other times I think that if I would have tried to talk to him more
he wouldn't have done it 

but it's possible 
that he got hit by accident 

but 
one thing I learned from him
a long time ago 

is that sometimes it was an act of defiance 
to love what you do 

it was a sentiment I appreciated 
and even if he did try to end his life 
it did not make it untrue 
when he was released from the hospital 
I went to visit him at home 

and at first he didn't want to talk to me 

I kept following him 
and trying to get him to talk 

but
he wouldn't

until he lost his temper and asked me what the fuck I wanted
I told him that I didn't know

he said that ever since he was in the hospital 
everyone suddenly wanted to talk to him 

so I stopped
and let him be 

I was walking back to my car 
and he told me to wait 

he told me that he didn't know why he wanted to kill himself 

I nodded and stood there 
and I didn't know what to say 

he asked what I was up to 
and I told him that I didn't know 

I felt a plastic thing pierced in my sock 
I took off my shoe 
it was a clear plastic thing that are sometimes on clothes when you first get them 

he told me that everyone told him he was an idiot
and they always thought he was high or lying 

I told him that I think every is an idiot and probably high or lying 
and he smiled and said that he thought that too 

<br>



in the field 

a massive piece of dirt was balancing on top of a power line 
like a vasectomy 

I was immunized by a screen saver
and now my fingers won't stop refracting off the graze 

the doorway peels the light from under the doorway 
and puts it in a tupperware 

I buried it in yard 
and that is why the dirt 

has found a decent amount of contentment 
<br>

now I am wearing sweatpants and I am sitting on the rocks 
and my ears have grown 
<br> 
that is the entirety of my life at the moment 
except that tomorrow I will use one of the coupons that we received in the mail last week to get a combo for six dollars
</p>
<p>



I ate the food and thought about my life and myself 

</p>
<p>

he went inside and his wife was happy to see him 
he started yelling at her and ranting about what had happened 
she looked out the window and saw his bike there 
he went upstairs and slammed the door 

she sighed and went outside
she wheeled his bike into the garage and went upstairs 
she quietly opened the door and he looked away from her 
she stood there 

she asked him how work was 
he told her he didn't want to talk about it 
she sat on the bed and put her hand on his back 
he said that it wasn't fair 

he had a meltdown and said that he didn't even want that bike anymore 
and that it was all bullshit 
his entire life
was all bullshit 

and then he began to cry 
she sat there and listened to him
until he stopped 
and then she told him that he was right 

his job was stupid 
and that he wasted his life 
she said she wished she never married him
and that he should kill himself 

he knew she was right 
and he asked her if she would help him do it
she said no, he had to do it himself 
she was busy 

she went downstairs and sat on the couch 
she turned on the tv and read an ebook on her ipad 
eventually she got tired 
and went upstairs 

he had hung himself and was dead 
idiot, she said
she called the ambulance and said her husband hung himself and is dead 
and she asked if she should take him down or if she should leave it to them 

</p>
<p>


he put his hand in the toaster
and held it there for as long as he could 

now he is staring at his hand 
and watching it blister 

he is thinking of when he was a kid 
and lit a wasp's nest on fire 

he is unsure why he is thinking of that moment

he unplugged the toaster from the wall
he walked to where he lit the wasp's nest on fire when he was a kid

and he found only grass and wind 

as he stood there, he felt sentimental 
and remembered a song he sometimes heard on the radio 

he couldn't remember the name of the song or who it was by 
but he knew one day he would hear it again 

</p>

<p>

I am sleeping 
in this moment 

I have gone upstairs 
and realized I was in the basement of a McDonalds 

I am walking home now 
drinking this giant coffee 

I am wondering how I ended up in the basement of a McDonald's 
the last thing I remember before that 

was looking at my new desktop background 
and trying to remember something that I had forgotten to write down two days ago 

I know you might not believe that this actually happened but it did 
I'm not making things up for the sake of general interest 

I'm not just sitting here, day after day 
fabricating banal scenarios, for no reason 

I really am drinking 
this McDonald's coffee 

</p>
<p>
I put on my old jacket 
my wife had sewn a patch into the elbow before
but the thread was coming loose in the wash 

I pulled the thread and it came out
and the patch fell out 

if I wouldn't have picked at it 
it probably would have been okay 

I felt somewhat devastated that it came off 
since it was very kind of my wife to have fixed it 

I knew she would say it's a strong reaction and it was something she could easily fix again 

I sat and looked at the patch 
it wasn't a perfectly cut square

maybe that's why I got so sentimental looking at it 

</p>
<p>

I hope that everything will end up okay 
and that my behaviour doesn't piss off 
the people in my life to such an extent 
that they will never speak to me again 

</p>
<p>
one day 
a guy 
was standing and feeling depressed 

he did not know how to answer a text message he got from a friend 
he didn't know why he didn't know how to answer 

he wanted to crush the cell phone in his hand and scatter the crumbs onto the ground

</p>
<p>

he was standing in his garage 
looking at all of his crap 

he knew he should clean the place up 
but he felt paralyzed by the sentiment 

of all the crap he had accumulated 
over the years 

it was truly all worthless garbage 
but he couldn't let it go 

his neighbour walked by 
and asked him what he was up to 

he told his neighbour he was cleaning the garage 
and the neighbour laughed at him 

he felt sad that his neighbour did that 
and he began to cry 

his neighbour asked if he was alright 
and he explained what was going on 

his neighbour told him to give him fifty bucks 
and he'd handle it for him 

so he did
he gave him fifty bucks 

and he stood there 
and watched as his neighbour threw all of his crap into the trash 

and then they drank some water 
and didn't have much to say to each other after that 

it was a bad idea all around 
and they both knew it 

he wished he still had all of his sentimental crap 
and his neighbour knew

that he should have charged at least a hundred bucks
for doing all of that work 
</p>
<p>

yesterday, he was crying outside of the grocery store 
his wife left him after he tried to kill himself 

even with a bachelor's degree in social work 
and a master's degree in social work 

she still didn't have the patience 
he begged her to change her mind 

but she was very stubborn 
and wouldn't take him back 

he ran face first into a tree

there was something so strange about getting hit on the face like that 
it was like it knocked him out for a brief moment 

he felt some momentary relief 
but still 
standing in the grocery store 
he cried at fish counter 

</p>

<p>

he has a room at the hotel 
it is near the convention center 

he is pretending he is on a business trip 

he keeps going to the buffet line 
the coffee is hot, the eggs were there

it's remarkable 
how little bullshit there is in this buffet line, he thought
you were a great villain, you were an awesome villain, he thought. 
you have relentless and untreatable tinnitus in your ass, he thought. 

he thought of inventing 
a virtual reality game called 
the chickens of the alcove 

in the game
there are chickens in your house 

and you have to get their eggs 
and then 

you have to make eggs
scrambled, fried, poached

omelettes, 
boiled 

he closed his eyes, as if putting on a virtual reality headset 
and he imagined walking around the house he used to share with his wife 

he saw the room where he hung himself 
a chicken stood near the window 

he noticed he hadn't thought to close the blinds when he hung himself 
the chicken lay and egg and it rolled towards him with the slant of the floor

it stopped at his foot and he picked it up
a pink five appeared in front of him and he heard a woman's voice say, great job! 

the five flew across his periphery and talied to his overall score 
it was a strange cloud like effect 

he then felt something bite at his ankle
it was a chicken pecking at him 

he kicked his leg 
and then another two chichens appeared and also pecked at his ankles 

he realized then that he might actually be dead 
but he could not tell 

it seems as though I may have stepped into hell 
with these chickens, he thought.

</p>

things have become quiet, here in hell 
I am eating toast 

the grass has become beige 
and the horizon is empty 

there is a small coffee shop 
about fifteen minutes away 

there is a sign on the door 
that says now hiring

I went in to order a tea 
I walked back to the hotel room 
I lay down to watch tv 
and then had a liquid fart 

there was no covering it up  
I called the front desk and told them I spilled coffee on the sheets
the housekeeper came to replace them 

she was kind at first 

but her attitude changed

when she saw the tea label 
hanging from my cups 

she realized that the stain wasn’t coffee after all

</p>
<p>
I will try to make peace with the chickens
here in hell, for now 

I have realized I am only an illusion in their world, 
like at one point, they were only an illusion in mine 

I will try to mind my business 
and eventually maybe I will find a way back 

it is possible to escape hell 
I've done it before 

but somehow 
I always end up back here 

somehow it feels like home 

</p>
<p>

 
I am unsure what I am saying exactly 

but I am good in this moment 

sitting at my computer 
and getting the time 
to write in my book 
<br>
I am not looking at some passing cloud 
I am not sacrificing doom drumbs 
<br>
remain oblivious
forward through the dirt 
<br>
checking email obsessively 
<br>
there is no shortcut there is only the dirt 
along the path 
along the doom crumbs

from the garden to the road 
</p>
<p>

something 
at the end

past where anyone can see it 
including me 

everything will become obvious 

perhaps there is a lamb 
standing beneath the streetlamp

perhaps there is an inanimate shadow 
reflecting in excellence 
<br>
it is abysmal without suffering 
and now I understand the sentiment 
but I am left wondering something

and I'm sure you are thinking it 
as well

who dried toothpaste 
in the sewer with doom crumbs 

he had no idea what he was doing 
and now he must grieve 
but he does not know how 

and then he slowly started panicking 
and he felt his pain was entirely frivolous 

<br>
when he spits his toothpaste into the sink 
he will sit at his desk
and he will write on a piece of paper 

</p>

<p>
standing at the wall
<br>
what the hell 
stop screaming 
<br>
I wish that I could help 
but I don't know if I will be able to 
<br>
almost twenty minutes have passed 
and I am thinking about it still 
<br>
I have come up with nothing 
I don't know what they are thinking 
I was just walking down the street

I was walking along 
and I said what the hell is all of this 

why are these people so depressed 
and obsessing over the lost and found box 

on the way back I saw a kid's winter hat on the ledge
someone had moved it off of the sidewalk 

you could see they put it there and brushed it off 
because they knew what it was like to lose a good hat like that 
</p>

<p>

some guy was standing around 
what the hell 
he said 
and he looked at something on the ground 
<br>
he didn't know 
who put it there
<br>
I don't want to think about any bullshit 
at the moment, he said
</p>

<p>
on the last day of my life 
lying in a hospital bed

I will drink the final cup of coffee 
and it will be really something

to know 
that was the last cup 

I don't even care 
how good it is 
<br>
I'll still drink it 
I'll take whatever they have
</p>

<p>
it is pointless 
to mention 
at this point 

I am standing beneath a flashing light 
in the ceiling 

watching the flash of light 
the beeping will never end 

that is what has become of it all 
it is too late now
I am going to come back later

</p>
<p>
a yellow piece of paper 
an antenna 

become an imbecile 
become a wire still 

continue to try 
idiot 

</p>

to the end of it 

the qualm 
in any regard 

is simply a paint roller in dog shit 
and some idiot was painting the house 
</p>
<p>
a pointless moment 
sitting near an air conditioner 

I looked up a word 
that I thought I knew the definition of 

but then I realized 
it doesn't really mean what I thought it did 

I may have crawled into the microwave 
and cooked myself down to a dog skeleton 

I am a microwaved dog skeleton 
running down the street 

I will only be respected
if I accomplish nothing 

</p>
<p>
a trash can lid on the ground next to a trash can 

abbreviated trash that has spilled out from the trash can 

sometimes 
things stop being what they are 
and are only trash 

standing on a dvd
neon beams reflecting all around 

some guy died instantly from running head first into a cactus 
he had bad dandruff 

meanwhile I am sitting here 
playing internet chess 

I may want to reflect a bit, knowing death was coming 
but that is the thing about death, it is always coming 

in that case I will have to reflect 
<br>
<br>
I gave it a shot 
and I found that I was screaming 
with my underpants around my ankles 
</p>

<p>
I was in home depot 

I saw a guy walk in there had his head glued to his own ass
he stood at the returns counter 
and returned a saw and a glue gun 
and they didn't even ask him any questions 

he just gave them the receipt 
and his credit card 
and they refunded it 

they are pretty good 
about returning things there 
</p>

<p>
it is like
if you are there 
and there are pencil shavings 
in a box

there is no deeper meaning 
there is nothing to understand
it is just pencil shavings

</p>

<p>

I thought that it required an unprecedented amount of effort 
but I don't know if that's it anymore 

instead to complete the same task over and over again 
maybe that is reasonable enough 

<br>
the guy who makes the egg salad
was sitting on a milk crate 

he was crying inconcolobly 
it was because his cat ran away 

it happens every few months 
and every time it does he just loses it 

he still showed up for his shift and was doing his work 
but then he just broke down 
 
he told me that he'd rather be dead 
than be away from his cat

I don't think he was lying 
<br>

when he went back in 
he saw the vat of egg salad was tipped over 

he screamed fuck and kicked over the mop bucket 
but then he saw some paw prints in the egg 

and there was his cat, eating the egg salad 
he is okay now 
</p>

<p>
a strange insecurity 
that I assume is pointless 

a sheer and utter mundane death 
some other random thing

god damn it you idiots 
write down a piece of paper 

the guy did 
and then gave that piece of paper that had nothing with anything 

and then the rabbi told them each to go home 
and put a fart inside of a plastic bag and bring it back the following day 

they each did that 
one of the guys had to stay up until three in the morning to catch a fart 

they returned the next day
and gave the rabbi the fart bags 

and the rabbi smelled both of them 
and grimaced 

give me the paper 
he told the third party witness 

he read the paper 
it said, radish ass 

you say the fart smelled like radish ass? 
the rabbi asked him

yes
the accuser said 

I smelled no such thing 
said the rabbi 

the accuser did not know what to say 
he looked depressed 

the rabbi then gave him the minestrone 
and told him to sleep with his face in it 

and he gave the other guy the whisker 
and told him to put it on the subway tracks 

if they did these things 
all would be forgiven 

the men agreed to the terms 
and that was the resolution to their conflict </p>

<p>

I would imagine any god 
worth his salt 

would use a lot of helium 
it is a great practical effect 

my wife asked me 
what the point of circumcision was...

I told her it was because in the womb 
things were good 

but when a baby is born 
they had to know that things were not fair anymore 

I don't know if that's the actual reason 
maybe I will ask the rabbi

I wondered if there was ever a foreskin 
floating in helium 

</p>
<p>

I just sat there and kept reading 
because at the end of the day 
what the fuck are you going to do 
</p>
<p>
I can imagine it must be sad, doing whatever it is you are doing 
thinking about all of the things you got to do in your life 
the leaves and the mud and the sun 
it wasn't long ago that it all began and now it is over 

the snow and the cold
they had a way of slowing down time 

and they were there with you
during your time on earth 

</p>
<p>

she stood there, her mouth agape 
it was all for nothing 

she stared blankly and screamed 

she didn't know where she was 
she stood staring upward 

a memory occurred to her 
when she knocked over a thing of white out 
and it stained her desk 

it seemed that things had a way of repeating themselves 
it seemed that to her, her only purpose was to suffer 

</p>

<p>

a can of alphaghetti 
was poured into a saxophone 

and then the saxophone player 
farted into the saxophone 

and sent the alphaghetti flying 

it was the best gig they'd ever got
that was their shot at the big league 
and the saxophone player blew it 

when they asked him why he did it
he just said that it was the call of the void 
and he did not explain anything more than that 

no one knew what he was talking about 
so he was fired from the band
<br>
since then they have been trying to get their reputation back 
but the truth is they aren't that good without the saxophone player 

they shouldn't have fired him for doing that 
they should have just went with it 

but they made their choice and what's done is done

</p>

the messiah 
of all time 

the salad
is green slime in a ziplock 

not to mention 
for no reason 
one of them was something 
that no one could describe 

and now after dying there was nothing 
it was permanent death 

where are the messiahs 
now 
that reincarnation, is no longer that 

now that condensed milk 
is the only thing on earth 
ever

and indiscernible ziplocks of green slime 

even I am dead at this point 
when the messiahs 
arrived

there isn't much else to really understand 
one way or another 
it's just the way it went 

the messiahs are completely monotone but they will procreate 
hopefully they will know what to do 
with the condensed milk and the ziplock slime 

I suppose we have to have faith 
that they will reincarnate the earth 
or else what kind of messiahs would they be

<br>

the messiah 
was going along the road 
and saw a massive dead worm 

the messiah did not know what to do 

he had no idea how to bring a dead worm back to life 

I am a failed messiah he said
I couldn't even save this worm 

the messiah felt depressed for a long time after that 

almost six days went by before he felt like he could do anything 

he went to the supermarket
and bought a soda
and he drank it on the sidewalk 

too bad about that worm 
god said 
the messiah nodded 

I hope you enjoy the soda 
god said
the messiah nodded again 

take it easy 
god said
and the messiah nodded 

hey wait
the messiah said 
to god

what? god asked him
I quit
the messiah said 

alright but you owe me for the snow tires god said
fuck those snow tires the messiah said 
and god laughed at the messiah
<br>

the messiah 
was sad 
and unable to articulate why 

its eyes were droopy 
and it felt like 
it had little connection to the others 

it was not a suicidal moment 
for the messiah  
or even one that it felt like it would benefit from crying 

it was just sad maybe for the hell of it 

the messiah went to mcdonalds
and bought a medium coffee for one dollar 

it stood in the park 
and remembered 
hopelessly staring at the dead worm 

the messiah felt a bit better
when he remembered 
how hopeless and depressed he was then 

and that is why god laughed when the messiah quit 
outside of the supermarket  

and it is why god never ended up making the messiah pay for the snow tires in the end

a twig 
under the door 

twig mucus 
was stuffed into a hotel room 

twig mucus 
was jammed into the lock 

twig mucus 
was launched at the wall 

it was depressing 
but no one did anything 

god put twig mucus 
on the ground 

so that lawnmowers 
would become benign 

and then 
people would eat twig mucus 

they would wear sweatpants constantly 
and die less often 

I did not expect to learn 
that no one would ever ejaculate again 

and try to say 
that it was twig mucus 

but people have been doing that lately 
and making tons of money off of it 

the exhaustion has become the concern 
of the community 

they have realized something 
they have realized that twig mucus 
is the equivalent of a benign desire to help them 

but I fell asleep and didn't give a shit 
because nobody gives a shit about anything when they are asleep 

but hopefully this wave of apathy will transpire 
into an extremely high price 

I don't know how long my nap will be
so who knows how long it will be there on the doorstep

if the squirrels want them
then fine, they can have them

go ahead squirrels
take it 

it's my gift to honour twig mucus 
<br>

the shopping cart was full of twigs and twig mucus 

I pushed it through the parking lot 
and the receipt went flying in the wind 

it was long gone it went into a cloud 

we drove home and on the way 
the car became totalled 

so we lit it on fire and walked home 

I will miss that old car 
I always thought that one day we would drive it

but I guess I was wrong 
we will have to buy a new car now 

I think that will be the end of twig mucus 
at least I hope it is 

so there it is and if that isn't enough 
nothing ever is or will be 

believe in whatever the hell you want 
I could care less

he said fuck you 
constantly 

he said it to children
and to old people 
and pregnant women and homeless men 

but he never said fuck you to his wife 
he would never say fuck you to his wife

he would say it to anyone, but not to her 
he was a man who loved his wife 

he loved her very much 

he was chugging coffee 
and thinking about stuff

he was standing outside and looking at his watch 
it had been difficult to get along with people 

but it was a good thing when it worked out
sometimes it worked out 

the truth is 
he didn't put that much effort in 

he saw it as a fault then but he could see now 
how important it was 

that it may be good to sit quietly and to try to be calm 

the world could seem incompetent at times 
but he realized, he was the through line 

he was both ends of the line 
</p>

<p>

I once wrote about someone who was sitting on a chair 
to such an extent 

that she was just sitting on a chair 
looking at her cell phone 

she cried a lot after it happened 
it was difficult

</p>

<p>

he stands in the gutter for days
with his middle fingers held upwards 

there is a strange sadness that he lives with 
he tries to handle it but it can be difficult

some days are better than others 

</p>
<p>

I have written an entire page
and deleted it 

to be cement 

a dog runs across the road 
and disappears into the grass 

his owner is dead 
and now he is running 

meanwhile 
everything else is merely a screensaver 

and if the mouse never moves 
it will go on forever 

I suppose it is good 
to think of these scenes 

and to let them exist 
on their own merit 

it seems for whatever reason 
I am feeling a bit better 

having written a page 
and not deleting it 

</p>

<p>

I am trying to think of how I've been doing 
the past few days 

I am feeling something that I can't figure out 

I am not sure how to describe it 
I am sitting here trying to figure it out 

</p>
<p>

some idiot didn't flush the urinal 

</p>

<p>
next week we're going on our honeymoon 
we've been married almost a year now 

today I did ok

it wasn't perfect but I think I did alright 

</p>

<p>
now I am looking at that and I can see it 
<br>
I forgot to mention 
I went to the new library yesterday 
<br>
I read a book and then I went to a restaurant and caught up on my chess moves 

</p>

<p>
there is always a stick on the ground, 
or a rock 
to be found 

today 
has been strange 
more or less 

for no reason in particular 
perhaps dehydration 
or something like that 

the strangeness 
of ear hair 

perhaps when we return from our trip 
I will do that 
I will write it on a post it note –– ear hair 

sometimes a single black one will sprout 
from a random place
but it seems that there are many white ones, growing from the canal 

and I think there is a dry scab in it 
I find myself picking at it 
when I read 

I would say definitively I am reading and picking 
at the ear canal scab
</p>

<p>

now that Miriam is in her second trimester 
I am allowed to talk about it 

for the past however long, I have been compartmentalizing my attempts 
<br>
to write from the subconscious 

but that is neither here nor there
what matters 

is that we will have a baby girl 
she will be born in June, 2023

there's something that happens when I think about it

a surge of emotional something or other 
it kind of swells the eyes and connects to the chest 

it isn't overwhelming but it is –– whelming 

for now she is doing somersaults and the like 
I saw her in three dimensional black and white 

I saw her hands and her feet

</p>

<p>
there is nothing that causes me as much anguish 
than having to be away from my cat 

I know I often write a lot of bullshit

but 
the thought of being away from him when we go on our trip 

I feel like I am going to cry every minute 
and we haven't even left yet 

he will be at home with my mother in law 
but still 

it's unbearable and I don't have the mental strength to handle it 
I should cancel the flight 

he is sleeping now 
on his chair 

I will miss him a lot 
</p>

<p>

we are walking around and eating food 
and I am picking my nose every once in a while 

there were a lot of people crowded around 
some guy attached a blowtorch to a stick to light a candle that was very high up 

meanwhile people were watching the soccer game 
and we were eating a sandwich across the street 

there were many cats in the streets 
eating scraps from the market
watching them makes me understand why my cat is the way he is 

he would like it here 

I am thinking of him often and hope that he is doing okay at home <br>

we were exhausted
from walking as far as we did  
 
we shared a bowl of soup 

</p>
<p>

it seems that my worst self 
is the one that is unable to find meaning and fulfilment 

sometimes I am able to sort it out 
sometimes not 

</p>

<p>
I saw that someone had made a tiny chessboard 
out of tiny pieces of paper 
and I could see how important a game can be 

these people who had been separated from their families 
and had everything stripped away from them 
I saw that they still found a way to write and to play chess

I don’t know what the meaning of it is exactly 
but it made me feel connected to those 
people 

</p>

<p>

I am drinking maxwell house coffee
and listening to a rooster 

I would say that the coffee isn’t too bad
but this fucking rooster can go to hell

CONSIDERING SOUP

today 
I made asparagus soup

first I cooked the asparagus 
in the pot with some oil 

and then 
I added in some onions and garlic 

and some water 
and salt and pepper 

we had a chicken bone broth pack thing 
that I added too 

and at the last minute
I put in a little bit of dill 

everyone had a bowl 
and they liked it 

there is even a bit left
that we will eat for lunch tomorrow 

I think that people should make soup 
more often 

I think that if more people made more soup 
the world would be a better place 

you can try to think of an argument 
against what I'm saying

but I doubt you will find a decent 
rebuttal 

I know that I say a lot of things that don't always make sense 
or that are idiotic 

but this 
this is the real thing 

this thing about soup 
is as true 

as anything 
ever 

if you think I'm wrong then you don't know jack shit 
and you can eat your own ass 

so man
good luck with that CONSIDERING HOME

I called my mom today 
and we spoke on the phone 
for a little bit 

I hope that she is doing ok

I moved away from home 
a long time ago 
I think all the way back in 2010 

twelve years 

when I was a kid, maybe four years old...  
she told me a bed time story 
about a kid who ran away from home 

he packed some peanut butter sandwiches
and some snacks in his backpack 
and he ran away from home 

he got lost and met all these dinosaurs 
who were kind to him 
eventually they helped him out and he went back home 

and everything was alright in the end 

it's one of my earliest memories 
I doubt she remembers it 
but I always remembered that story 

it is difficult to be away from the people that you love
DIM SUM

it was nice to take the subway 
in the afternoon 

it's faster than driving 
and we don't have to fuss with parking 

we had a checkup appointment 
at the doctor 

I was making chess moves on my phone 
while she was talking 

and I realized I probably shouldn't do 
that

the nurse used some kind of radio machine 
and we heard the baby 

swimming around 
the water 

afterward 
we went for dim sum 

and ordered a lot of food 
I was feeling like we spent too much money on it all 

but then there were enough leftovers
that we had ate it for dinner also 

most of all 
I am looking forward to meeting our daughter 

when the time comes 
I will try to teach her what I know 
FLIP MITTS

I was online shopping 
for a pair of gloves that I can use my phone with 

they have special fingers 
so you can text 

I read some of the reviews 
and a lot of people are saying ––

god damn these fucking gloves don't work for shit ––  
they're warm –– but you can't type jack shit with these fucking things! 

I was scratching my head 
and looking through all of the options 

a lot of them are really expensive 
some are over a hundred bucks

I saw one pair that were highly recommended by many 
but they cost forty bucks

and then I had the realization 
that I could get those old style mitts that flip so your fingers come out

then you don't have to worry about anything 
and they are probably cheap 

problem solved
get the flip mitts 

but first
I'll check and see what they have at Costco 

it's always good to do that 
that's how I was raised at least 

and then, that way 
maybe I'll get a hot dog or something after MOTIVATIONAL SPEECH

it is good to write the most fucked up story you can 
it is good to write whatever the hell you want 

it is good to write the most bizarre possible thing 
it is good to write something that people won't give two shits about 

it is good to put effort into not giving a fuck 
it is good to put effort into writing something people will think is too melodramatic 

it is good to put effort into writing something people will think is too mundane 
it is good to put effort into letting the story be what it is 

and finishing it 
and writing the next one 

I know sometimes it's a shit process 
and a lot of guys killed themselves over it 

reconcile your intuition and figure it out 
for your own sake

or die trying 
I suppose 
BROKEN DELETE KEY

I was standing in the hallway today 
and I thought of something 

girls sit down to pee
every time they go to the bathroom 

which means they always have the option 
to take a crap 

boys 
on the other hand 

don't always get to take a dump
every time they take a wiz 

it's smart 
the way they do it that way 

for the most part
they're probably way less constipated 

but there's no way I'm going to try to take a dump
every time I go to take a piss 

I'm looking at the hallway again now 
and I don't know why that occurred to me when it did 

I must admit 
that I wish I wrote something else here today

but my delete key seems to be broken 
it seems there's nothing I can do about it now HAVE YOUR SNOT MELT ON THE EARTH

I had a dream last night 
about some people that used to be my friends 
but we grew apart 

I am looking now 
at some gunk on the ground
and a hairball on my sock 

I went to two pet stores today 
and the dollar store 
and my buddy's house 

tomorrow 
I have to go out and lecture at the school 
I am looking forward to reading my book on the subway 

I am looking forward to being alone 
before I have to be with people
I am looking forward to coming back to my table here

I am looking forward to having some time to write 
I want to write about some emotional shit 
I want to write about the pet store 

and value burgers and melted snot 
and all the people who used to be my friends 
and some gunk on the ground and a hairball on my sock 

and then I want to write about value burgers 
and melted snot 
again 

I want to write about value burgers 
and melted snot
forever NO BULLSHIT, NO SCHEMING

tomorrow I would like to put on a pair of rubber boots 
and step into the mud 

I don't own rubber boots 
but I have my hiking shoes 

I will wear them 
and go to the park 

and step 
into the mud TWIG BURGER

there was a large twig 
in the value burger that I ordered 

when they gave me the paper bag 
the twig stuck out either side –– almost like a helicopter 

I opened up the packaging 
two pieces of bread, melted snot and a damn massive twig? 

I sat on the planter outside 
staring at it 

all I ordered was a single value burger with melted snot 
and they gave me a freakin twig burger? 

I took a bite 
thinking... maybe it was a giant french fry 

but I was wrong 
I knew I was wrong, but I didn't want to be right 

I didn't want the twig 
to be a twig 

I went back in 
and showed it to the employee 

we didn't put a fucking twig in your burger man 
they said 

and even if we did 
why the fuck would you take a bite out of it? 

I didn't have an answer 
instead I asked for some extra mustard 

they gave it to me 
and I ate my twig burger, value, melted snot & all 

sitting on the planter 
in the car exhaust 
THE INTRINSIC VALUE BURGER

I am wondering the value
of ––

the value 
burger

I am not questioning its value 
I am simply wondering, the value 

there is no value 
to snot, itself 

it simply is 
what it is 

the intrinsic value of the value burger 
is beyond my ability to calculate 

but rest assured 
when you sit down 

at the restaurant 
and open the packaging 

of the value burger 
you will not question its value 

intrinsic 
or not 

you will know
you did the right thingTWO KINDS OF FICTIONAL REGRET

the origami sewer 
is not what it sounds like 

there are no folded up pieces of paper 
there is no sewage 

the origami sewer is something else entirely 
I actually have no idea what it is 

for a moment I liked the sound of it 
but now I think it's stupid

I once lied and said my delete key was broken 
but I couldn't do that again 

the truth is 
I feel like talking about the regret 

it feels good 
to talk about fictional regret 

like watching fictional people shoot each other 
in an action movie

the origami sewer 
what a dumb idea

in a way 
it is kind of funny, I suppose 

instead I want to write about something else
I want to write about discounted cabbage roles at the hot bar

they were on for fifty percent off
I'm sure they are all sold out by now 

the truth 
is that I'm still talking about fictional regret 

because I walked right past them 
and I didn't buy them 

it happened this morning 
when we were at the supermarket MY TRIANGLE FRIEND

my friend is shaped as a triangle 
he looks like a cartoon some kid drew 

he is shaped as an actual triangle 
his arms stick out from his sides and his legs come out from the bottom line 

his eyes are slightly above his arms 
his mouth is slightly below his eyes and go across his entire body 

he was once offered a lot of money to be the Doritos mascot
but he was more interested in a less public job 

we talk on the phone often 
at least once a week, sometimes more 

he doesn't always have much to say 
and neither do I 

sometimes we just sit there on the line 
quietly 

he is obsessed with petroleum jelly and
he is a respected chiropractor 

he is hoping to find a girlfriend 
so if you know anyone that might be interested 

let me know 
and we'll see if it works outFREE VACATION

I have imagined a hotel 
called 
the dolphin spring hotel 

it is on the side of the highway 
it is not very expensive 
fifty nine dollars a night 

there are two vending machines 
side by side 
one is for drinks and the other is for candy and chips

if I stayed at that hotel 
I would just watch tv all day 
and order a pizza and get some sodas and eat chips 

instead 
I will just imagine it 
maybe that is enough 

to just imagine a thing 
and to be there 
that way 

you should get good at imagining things 
it is a cheap way
to travel

MY WIFE

I was talking to my wife
while I was buying something at the store

and she was telling me about her friend's 
diarrhea 

my wife tells me all kinds of things
she always has something to talk about

it is hard for me to feel like a piece of shit 
with her around 

it is hard for me to feel like a piece of shit 
even when I have diarrhea, with her around 

I never met anyone 
that sees the good in the world 

as effortlessly and authentically 
as she does 
CAPITALIST JOY

this weekend 
I am going to the book store 

I probably won't buy anything 
I just want to look at the books 

I already have a cat training book from the library that I need to
finish 

I am trying to learn some things to help our cat 
lately we have been taking him on a lot of walks and playing with his bird toy and springs a lot 

this weekend 
I might go to home depot 

I want to buy a new door for my office
I think it will help quiet things down 

and it would be nice 
to have a brand new door 

I saw one online 
that is made of pine 

it is three hundred dollars 
I don't know if I will buy it 

yet 
eventually I will I CAN'T BELIEVE IT TOOK ME 35 YEARS TO BEAT THIS FUCKING GAME ON EASY MODE

I have nothing left 
to say 

truly 
I think I have gotten to the end 

I have beat the game 
I am going to take this cartridge to the used nintendo store 

and get some credit
for another game 

or maybe 
I'll just take the cash 

it's always a shitty deal 
if you take the cash

you should always take
the store credit 

and even then
it's a shitty deal 

honestly
I don't think I'll trade it in 

because 
I was playing on easy mode

I can't believe it took me 35 years to beat this fucking game 
on easy mode

I suppose that settles it 
I will start again, now –– for the first time, perhaps 

this time 
I will set it to normal THE TRUTH INTO WORDS

"Dreams are disconnected, 
they accept the most violent contradictions without the least objection, 
they admit impossibilities, 
they disregard knowledge which carries great weight with us in the day-time, 
they reveal us as ethical and moral imbeciles. 

Anyone who when he was awake behaved in the sort of way that is shown in situations in dreams would be considered insane. 

Anyone who when he was awake talked in the sort of way that people talk in dreams or described the sort of thing that happens in dreams would gives the impression of being muddle-headed or feeble-minded.

It seems to be no more than putting the truth into words 
when we express our very low opinion of mental activity 
in dreams 
and assert that in dreams the higher intellectual faculties in particular are suspended 
or at all events gravely impaired."

Sigmund Freud 
1899
ONE OF THE BEST TIMES OF ALL TIME

I am happy to sit here 
at my computer 

wearing sweatpants 
and drinking a cup of water

and now 
I am going to think of something to write  

my wife is five months pregnant 
and she is making a cup of tea

our cat 
is running up and down the hall 

in a few months 
it will all change 

and in all likelihood 
I will remember how things are now

as one of the best times 
of all time COSTCO HOTDOG

my mother in law
brought me a hot dog 
from costco 
today 

it is the best item
it is the best snack
it is the best meal
it is the best thing

it comes with a free drink 
it is one dollar and fifty cents 
it is the reward for any suffering you have endured in your entire life 
it is the only time anyone is convinced that money is worth making 

please listen to what I'm about to tell you 
when you are at costco 
buy yourself a hotdog 
or buy one for a friend or anyone 

do not live a shitty life 
learn the value of a dollar
you will become better
you will return to who you are 

you will return 
to who
you have always 
been THE CAN OF TUNA IN THE SNOW

the blender 
is somewhere 

the mud
is beneath a cloud 

it was snowing 
and now it is not snowing 

at the moment there is no reason to wonder
about anything 

at the moment 
there is celery growing somewhere 

at the moment 
there is a computer chip inside of a piece of celery 

and someone will eat it 
accidentally 

they will know what it is like 
to eat a computer chip 

and it will be the day 
that they ate a microchip 

they will talk about it 
forever

they will talk about how they ate a microchip 
that one day 

they will stare at the wall
and they will not think of the insulation in it

they will think of the empty can 
of tuna 

that they saw 
in the snow 

even after they are dead
they will still remember it

it will be printed 
off an inkjet printer 

and they will never
forget

the can of tuna
in the snowTHE COLESLAW PETITION

the petition 
was written 

it was between a guy 
and himself 

the petition said 
that he was a motherfucker 

he felt that word described him 
better than any other 

when he thought of himself 
he liked thinking that he was a motherfucker 

I am no longer thinking about that guy 
I am now thinking about coleslaw 

in a plastic cup 
from the deli 

I would like to have a couple bites of that 
just the cheap kind from any deli 

I would eat it in the grocery store parking lot 
in the snow 

people would say 
that I was a motherfucker 

but I would give them the middle finger 
and I would tell them that I didn't sign any petition 

and I would toss the rest of the coleslaw at their windshield
or door 

and then there would be coleslaw 
frozen in the snow THE GREAT IDIOCY

it takes a lot of work 
to thoroughly not give a shit 

it is difficult 
not to give a fuck 

I give a lot of shits
and fucks

not from lack 
of trying 

I am 
still working on it

I am hoping to become 
as confident as possible 

without 
losing the great idiocy 

I would like to be confident enough
to be as naive 

as a complete dumb ass 
and not give a shit or a fuck

and to look at things 
as I do 

to look at things 
blissfully 

in a way that is so stupid 
that there is nothing 

left
aside 

from
what it is SNAIL FRIEND

a box of nails 
and a hammer 

a box of snails 
and a hammer 

snails 
nails 

I hope that no one would use a snail 
as a nail 

I saw a snail on the street
a few months ago 

it was just there
looking at the dirt 

I always liked snails 
I always thought they were funny 

I hope to know a snail one day 
I hope to have a snail as a friend 

to go for coffee with 
to ask advice of 

to split a large pizza with 
to shoot the shit 

a snail for a friend 
that sounds alright 

I hope I do not go the rest of my life
without a friend like that 

I hope I do not die
without having a snail as a friend THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE LATE FINES

I am imagining 
a bag of frozen 
spicy curly fries 

tomorrow 
I will walk through the snow 
while drinking coffee

I do not know what I will think about 
I will be by myself 
walking 

I am in a state 
of general happiness 
that is better than usual 

it is true 
that this is the best quality of life
I have ever lived

it is true 
that I have spent years 
as a miserable piece of shit 

it is true 
that I wasn't sure 
if it would subside 

or if that's what it was 
to walk around 
the snow, drinking coffee

still imaging 
frozen
curly fries 

it is possible 
to better yourself 
it is possible to figure things out 

in a way 
I hate to admit it 
but it's true 

one thing that helped then
was going to the library 
I don't know why, exactly –– but it did

back when they still had late fines
–– they got rid of late fines in our city 
which is bullshit 

there should always 
be
late fines 

there should always 
be
frozen spicy curly fries 

floating in a thought bubble
above your 
headTHE GREAT IDIOCY II

I became upset today 
for a few reasons 

one –– 
I slipped on the ice and scared my cat when we were outside and he bit my hand 

two –– 
the lecture I gave today fucking bombed, god damn it

three –– 
I returned my library book a day late 

and they don't even charge late fines anymore 
so I can't even reconcile it 

I feel like a failure 
and I feel tired 

but 
(and I'm not trying to be optimistic by saying this)

the truth is ––
I am enjoying looking like an idiot 

because I cannot deny 
that I am not fucking bullshitting myself 

so 
fuck off world 

and I know I have used the title already 
but I will use it again 

because I am feeling what it is 
–– the great idiocy EATING SHIT

you cannot be yourself 
without a lot of people thinking you are fucked

you cannot be yourself 
without a lot of people thinking you suck ass

you cannot be yourself without 
eating shit 

somehow I have become excited to eat shit 
tomorrow 

and 
on Friday 

imagine all the shit you can eat 
imagine the buffet of shit that is waiting for you 

as you learn 
to be who you are 

as you learn 
to be an honest person 

as you learn 
to have integrity 

you cannot be yourself 
without eating shit 

that is how 
it works LUCK AND HEARSAY

when I went downstairs 
to get a snack 

I saw my wife 
holding her cellphone speaker to her stomach, playing les mis for the baby 

now I am eating an orange
and potato chips

our cat 
is licking his paw 

I don't really feel like making anything up or saying anything important... 
but I will say this –– 

earlier today I was walking in the snow 
and I felt as good as I've ever felt in my life 

I've spent years of my life feeling miserable
for no good reason 

and my only advice to anyone is this –– 
don't bullshit yourself 

to the best of your ability, make choices that align with who you are 
and that will allow a chance for things to turn up 

as far as I'm concerned 
everything else is luck and hearsay IDEA FOR A NOVELTY CHESS T-SHIRT

I thought of a new catch phrase today
"it's never too late to castle" 

I would get it written on a t-shirt 
and there would be a king and a rook on it 

there would be two versions of the shirt 
one would be black and have white pieces

and the other 
would be white and have black pieces on it 

otherwise 
I don't have much to say 

except 
writing stories 

is difficult 
they are next to impossible to get right 

but 
it is worth trying 

I don't know how to tie that thought 
back to the one about the chess t-shirt 

which I suppose
proves my point 

that writing stories 
is next to impossible 

to get 
right
SUBWAY COUPONS

I ate a massive sandwich 
for supper

I have no feelings 
they are constipated in the sandwich 

I have forgotten who I am 
from eating that sandwich 

the coupon came in the mail 
it expires this week

so we went for it
we used the coupon 

I am so full 
I have no feelings 

I should have only had half 
of that sandwich 

I will sleep soundly 
this evening 

unless I have night tremmors 
from the digestion 

I will make sure the switch 
to my nightlight is handy 

in case I wake up 
screaming 

I don't know if I regret it altogether 
but I will be weary in the future 

of those coupons 
that come in the mail A GREAT CARTOON

I am working on 
a great cartoon 

so far it is eight minutes 
and forty five seconds 

I have done five of the 
nine scenes 

in the end 
it will probably be... 

hold on 
I need a calculator 

I think it will be about 
fifteen minutes 

that is a lot 
but I worked on the story for a long time 

I am worried
that it will be too crass for some

as I type that 
I realize 

that is a pussy ass thought 
that is a great way to become the world's biggest bitch

I am glad I chose to write about the cartoon 
to catch that thought 

I don't want to worry 
about dumb shit like that anymore 

I don't want to worry 
about people and whatever fuckin shit 

I want to make my work 
for myself 

I don't want to worry 
about any bullshit ever again 

I hope that if you are making anything 
you also are done giving a fuck 

enjoy what you are doing –– as much as you can 
that is the skill 
THE COMPUTER

I suppose 
there is little to nothing to say 

it is peaceful 
here

I am complacently looking 
at this glasses cloth thing 

the thing you use 
to clean your glasses

when I was a kid and they told me I needed glasses 
I was scared shitless 

but now 
I like wearing my glasses 

I was probably ten or something 
now I am thirty five

there is a picture of me from around that time
and I'm sitting on the computer 

it is possible I've spent most of my life 
on the computer 

I have no problem with that 
I have always enjoyed being here 

I suppose it is strange
how little I feel like I have to say 

but for me it is enough 
to remember some good days from back when I was a kid
WHEN IT IS TIME

I don't know if you have ever had a pregnant wife before
but

it is something 
to put your hand on her belly

and to feel that there is a baby there 
I don't really have the words to describe it

it is some combination 
of fear and awe 

the pants that used to be too big on her 
now fit her well

I am excited to meet our daughter when it is time
in a way I feel like I know her already 

I wanted to mention 
one other thing as well 

the name we chose for her 
has the same first letter as my wife's great grandmother 

she used to give onion and schmaltz sandwiches to homeless people
during the great depression

today I ate a sandwich like that for lunch 
and I thought it was good
PLOT AND PLOTLESSNESS

there is a difference 
between writing plot 

and writing 
to say what you need to say 

I was working on plot all day today 
and now I feel like shit 

I feel like I didn't get anywhere
writing plot gives me fucking indigestion 

it is fucking hard to write a story 
I don't know 

sometimes I think that the best thing to do 
is ignore it completely 

both plot 
and plotlessness are misery 

I feel better already
having written those two lines 

than the eight or nine or however many hours 
I put into breaking down my story today 

sometimes people ask me what I'm writing 
and I get embarrassed and fumble my words pretty badly 

even after working on something for hundreds of hours
I can't articulate it 

I am happiest
writing about things that I can't explain –– ordinarily 

trying to sort out the unknown 
and if I knew what the fuck I was saying 

I wouldn't feel the need to say it 
that is the whole point 

so what I'm saying now 
is fuck it all DO NOT GIVE PEACE A CHANCE

I didn't have the most productive week 
not from a lack of trying 

I lost sight of myself somehow 
I fuckin hate when that happens 

without that though –– 
there would be nothing to do 

it would be too stagnant 
if you knew who you were, at all times 

if you could never push yourself into doubt 
and confusion 

there would be no fucked up nonsensical poems 
there would be no searching 

I would say this 
despite popular opinion 

–– do not give peace a chance 
do not trust it for a second 

it is a deceptive feeling 
it will bite you in the ass

and trust me 
you don't want to get bit in the ass 

my suggestion then 
is to forget everything you know 

become the stupidest person 
possible 

become a complete idiot 
beyond all comprehension 

if you do not become a complete dumbass
you will get bit in the ass by god knows what 

and you will be eternally miserable 
and you will never write well 

that is what I know 
thank you for your time 

and by the way
I got a good haircut today 

it's looking pretty spiky 
especially for a bald guy 
QUITTING FICTION

I haven't been too interested 
in writing made up stories lately 

but really –– the impulse will return 
it always does

we bought a baby stroller  
off some woman online today

it cost us 80 dollars 
new it costs 500

the woman we bought it off 
seemed very kind and used it for three kids already 

we brought it home and messed around with it in the garage 
it seems like it will be good for us 

we are trying to decide how we will spell the baby's name 
... if there should be an h at the end or not 

I don't think the h is necessary 
but my wife likes it 

I told her that if our daughter wants the h 
I will take her and we can get it legally changed

I am putting it in writing here
so there's no going back on it

when you write something down –– it's real 
that's how it works now that I've quit fiction 
AIMING FOR A MEANINGLESS OUTCOME

I keep deleting what I've written 
the momentum is off for some reason 

I have been lost in a fantasy 
about quitting fiction writing 

a fantasy 
is an attempt to augment our reality

it is a way of reconciling 
the anxiety of the moment 
 
the idea of quitting fiction writing 
is a fantasy and a fiction in itself 

the question I would ask
as usual –– is –– what is the fiction trying to reconcile 

whether it is a wish fulfillment 
or an attempt to organize the world into something understandable... 

there is no real need to quit 
but 

I am learning to allow myself to write here like I do in my journal 
regardless of if it is boring 

I don't know why I resisted it 
but it seems refreshing 

it is important to write the truth 
whether it is fiction or not 

the outcome of it all will define itself
for now, it's best for it to remain meaningless OUR DATE

for valentine's day 
we went to five guys burger restaurant 

we ate some peanuts while we waited 
for them to cook our burger and fries

there are unlimited refills there 
we had diet coke and iced tea

we had a good time there
and I would look forward to going back one day 

afterward we went to some other stores
we looked at some baby clothes

we bought a new shower curtain 
we bought quail eggs for our cat

it was a good way to spend the evening 
usually we don't go out on Tuesdays 

but we had a full tank of a gas 
and it was valentine's day 

so we thought we'd make the most 
of our date 
A SINCERE CONGRATS

today I finished working on my cartoon 
I think that it is the best thing that I've ever done

I have never given a sincere bow before 
until today 

of all the years 
of feeling like I couldn't get it right 

this one 
works

I was able to say 
what I wanted 

I was able to be
myself 

it is not that often I feel as proud as I do 
of this cartoon 

so I will take a moment to give myself 
a pat on the back & a sincere congrats... 

–– good work buddy 
you did it –– 

I have been trying to make a cartoon like this 
since I was a kid 

I will look forward to sharing it
online soon CHEESE BLINTZES

today we went to one of our favourite grocery stores 
we always go there and look at the sales 

they have cheese blintzes 
that go on sale 

6.99 for 6 of them 
instead of 12.99 for 6 of them 

I buy a pack every time they are on sale 
I love eating them 

ever since I was a kid 
cheese blintzes have been one of my favourite foods

even now as I am thinking of blintzes 
I am overwhelmed with happiness 

my mom used to make them for me on my birthday 
every year 

there is almost nothing as dear to me 
as that 

there are certain things that are imprinted onto your being 
that bring you back to who you are 

it is beyond sentiment 
for me –– it is cheese blintzes 

I will hope to be there for our daughter 
as she figures out 

what it is 
for herTHE IDIOT TREE

here is the new story 
that I've been working on –– 

it is about a man 
who lives alone in the woods 

he goes into town to get gas from costco 
and there is a big snowstorm 

he ends up driving a woman home
she works at the costco restaurant 

he ends up getting her pregnant 
and now... he needs to make money 

so he takes some mushrooms from a tree in the woods (that's the idiot tree from the title) 
and brings them to the farmer's market 

but he doesn't sell any of them 
so he steals a bag of money from a brinx truck 

he drives until he runs out of gas 
and then he is lost 

he meets an archaic cult 
and learns that the money he stole is useless to them 

their currency is based around ritual sacrifices 
to their higher power 

eventually he begins to understand and adopt their point of view 
and captures a very important animal 

he is set free from the cult 
and finally returns home 

his girlfriend, the woman from costco who he got pregnant 
suggests that it is probably best if he is a stay at home dad 

he agrees 
and realizes he probably should have been more patient with the mushrooms 

that is more or less 
the story 

the ritual sacrifice stuff I took from reading exodus late last year 
in those times... burning animals to a higher power was a very intense thing to do 

imagine having to hunt your own food 
and never really having enough 

and then destroying it
on purpose 

burning it to show your faith 
to a higher power 

it is better to shop at costco 
and get a hot dog from the restaurant there 

as fictional as it all is... 
it's not really that fictional 

at the end 
of the day 
DANDRUFF SHAMPOO

there was a type of dandruff shampoo 
that my wife wanted me to get 

but they didn't have it 
at the store we looked at 

there is always dandruff from my beard
that goes on my shirt 

it makes me feel 
like a loser or something 

it is like when you first start going bald 
it takes some work to get used to it 

or if you feel like your beard has grown too long 
and people will think less of you because of it 

or if your clothes are dirty 
or old or don't fit well 

or if you peed your pants 
or if you have a booger in your nose or something 

sometimes it is hard not to care 
how you look 

I think it is good to try 
to care as little as possible 

but I know 
sometimes it's hard not to THE DOORKNOB OF LIGHTNING

the doorknob 
of lightning

has become 
entirely useless 

it is a shame 
and many people are disappointed 

personally 
I could care less about it 

I don't even know what it is 
I'd rather sit around eating pistachios 

or stand on the curb
looking at a fried fish sandwich poster in the window of a fast food restaurant 

I suppose that is all there is to say 
I don't have any news about acorns or twine if that's what you were expecting 

one time when I was in the grocery store with my sister
she poked her finger into a thing of ground beef 

because she thought it looked like a brain 
I'll never forget that moment 

it was the pinnacle 
of it all 

it was the doorknob 
of lightning GOING TOWARDS THE MCDONALDS

I was walking towards the McDonalds today 
and caught myself thinking 

that I would fail 
as a writer etc... 

but I caught the thought
and adjusted it

it takes effort
to stay hopeful

about whatever it is 
you have decided to be hopeful about 

it is easier 
to think that you will be defeated 

figure out what perspective is required 
to keep you going ahead 

towards whatever the fuck 
you are aiming at 

do not believe in yourself 
blindly 

do not defeat yourself 
blindly 

go towards the McDonalds 
get the coffee

a medium cup is only one dollar
from now until some time in march 

get it now
while supplies last THE KNIVES IN THE BLOCK

and now 
it is time to write out some thoughts 

sometimes 
there is a hollowness, an empty honeycomb above me 

and other times 
there is a lot of untethered emotional –– honeycomb 

it is possible that one is better than the other
but I don't care

I like to sit and write out my thoughts 
even if I have none 

even if I am brain dead 
or am standing under a tree and snow has fallen on my head or something like that 

at the best of times 
sitting and writing causes distraction 

all of the knives in the block are facing outward
and you have decided that you want to walk into it 

and you are going to stand there 
and pretend that you are fine 

well I suppose that's an exaggeration 
it's not always like that 

sometimes it is okay 
and I am sitting here pleasantly 

like right now 
it is good 

I used to think that was not how to write 
good 

but now 
I don't care

writing good 
is dumb FIGMENT

I never bothered looking up the word –– figment 
until now

it is something that someone believes to be real 
but only exists in their imagination 

I think before I thought that it meant 
a small piece 

like a morsel 
or something like that 

often I sit here 
figmenting 

but sometimes I figment too much 
and I feel like getting a dose of reality 

so I go and stick my head into the snow 
or do some pushups 

I don't have much else I really feel like going on about 
but I will note

that I had a calm and focused day 
I did alright

it was an average day and at the end of my life 
I would probably look back and say that it was the best day of my life

but until then I will consider it ordinary 
and I will look forward to continuing my work tomorrow 

RAT POISON
there are mice in our cupboards 
and now that we know they are there

they will have to 
die 

we put some poison out for them 
I surrounded it in a fortress 

of canned 
beans 

they nibbled into our matzoh box
and ate off the label of a jar of peanut butter 

our cat is young enough 
that he's never seen a mouse 

wait until he figures them out 
all of the hours playing with springs and feather toys 

all of his training 
put to the test 

we all have to grow up 
someday 

I feel like making a grand statement 
something like ––

eventually we either eat the rat poison 
or kill the mouse 

but that's totally meaningless
and banal 

I suppose the scheme has gone 
awry A LIGHT SWITCH

the mix of dolphin square pizza pops 
and origami regular pizza 
was mesmerizing 

I know I said that I wouldn't write 
meaningless abstract shit anymore
but this is serious 

some guy farted into a light switch 
and then when his girlfriend turned on the light 
it smelled like complete ass

she was so pissed at him 
she went into the freezer 
and threw all of his pizza pops out into the road 

he was so depressed 
he went into the road 
and fell to his knees 

he cried 
and mourned the pizza pops 
she tried not caring but she couldn't help it 

she went out into the street 
and she tried to calm him down 
eventually she understood why he was so upset about those pizza pops

they were the ones that they got from dolphin square
on their first date 
he said he was saving them for a special occasion 

she looked at them and the guilt overwhelmed her 
she didn't know what the appropriate reaction was 
to someone farting in a light switch 

eventually she saw that there was another pizza in the road 
someone had run over it and it was folded into weird shapes 
it was a strange coincidence and she wanted to assign some meaning to it 

but she couldn't 
so 
she just stared at it 
IT SEEMED TRIVIAL WHEN I RE-READ IT

I wrote some things here before
but then I deleted them 
and now I will start again 

I was writing about the snow 
but it seemed trivial 
when I re-read it 

it felt like I was saying something important 
but I second guessed it 
and decided it wasn't true 

I went down some rabbit holes today 
watching the snow 
and worrying about what people think 

it is easy to lose sight of things 
when you sit too long in your chair 
doing nothing

but if I do not sit long enough 
in my chair 
I have no idea who I am 

I will always want to sit 
and write things 
down 

I would like to say 
that everything else can go fuck itself 
and for the most part it can 

but if you do not walk around 
and break it up a bit 
you will fuck yourself

it is good when it is snowing out
it is good to walk in the snow 
for no reason

it is good to sit in a chair 
and write things down 
for no reason I AM A GLOB OF TOOTHPASTE EXPERIENCING MODERATE JOY

the anteater 
became a glob of toothpaste 

the anteater 
melted in the sun 

his credit card went off 
into the gutter 

he was at the bookstore
looking at new journals 

and he felt like a little bitch 
for doing that 

he remembered typing shit into DOS
when he was a kid 

and now 
his credit card went towards the gutter

and now
he was a glob of toothpaste, melted in the sun 

I never identified with an anteater before
until this morning 

this morning I was thinking of some song lyrics 
I have been hearing in the background for my entire life 

"I don't care who you are
what you did 

where you're from
as long as you love me" 

it was bullshit when it came out
and it's bullshit now 

so fuck off
with that shit 

and now 
after a day of being melted 

I have returned 
and all I will say is this –– 

I am a glob of toothpaste 
experiencing moderate joyFOR NOW THAT IS AS MUCH AS I KNOW

lately 
I have wanted to write better poems 

but 
thinking about writing poems 

leads to writing 
worse poems 

all you can do 
is sit down and write 

I have not edited a poem I have written 
in years 

I just write them 
and then move on to the next one 

I edit a lot of other shit 
but not these 

that's what makes them 
what they are 

the whole point 
maybe –– 

is that I have to accept them 
even when they are pieces of shit 

and in turn 
I have to accept myself 

as 
well 

in a way
it is easier 

to delete
and rewrite

and start again 
in a way 

it is excruciating 
to delete 

and rewrite
and start again 

I will always debate
which path is the one worth taking 

to repeatedly bang my head against the wall
getting it right 

or squishing the spaghetti in my hand 
and looking deep into the tomato sauce 

but at the end of the day 
the answer is simple

you must repeatedly bang your head against the wall 
while squishing the spaghetti in your hand and looking deep into the tomato sauce

for now 
that is as much as I know LOUISA'S STORY

when I was a kid 
my mom used to tell me about her dad

he died the same year 
I was born 

she tried to explain that his spirit lived on through us 
and I understood what she meant 

I have seldom seen her be as sincere 
as that 

a few years ago 
I wrote a script about my mom and how I imagined her childhood to be 

the script is focused around 
the sentiment I remembered her explaining, all those years ago 

for some reason or another 
I thought of animating that script today

and I realized that 
soon I will have a daughter and be her dad 

and one day, one way or another
she will lose me

it never occurred to me that I would be in the same position 
that my grandfather was 

and that she will be in the position 
that my mother was 

I would like to pass down the sentiment that my mother passed 
onto me 

I have decided that I will try to make that animation 
to give to her one day 

so that regardless of what happens 
she will have that OR SOMETHING

farting on an iguana's head
with a flashlight 

in the distance 
the flashlight looks like a streetlight 

but it is just the distance 
or something 

I am trying to draw a picture 
of a gas station 

but it is difficult 
to get it right 

I don't know why I wrote 
about farting on an iguana's head

but 
I think I will stick with it 

what would be the point of deleting it 
now

I cannot be ashamed
of writing 

about farting
on an iguana's head 

if I am ashamed of that
then 

writing about the shame of it 
instead

will be more
intellectual 

or 
something 

like the flashlight 
and the streetlight 

they are the same in the distance 
or something I WILL GO ON SALE BEFORE I EXPIRE

I don't think that I will die anytime soon
but it is possible 

if I died 
I am most concerned about my wife and daughter and cat 

I know that they would be okay 
but –– 

I suppose what I want
most of all 

is to get to be with them 
in the future 

I'm not looking for a big adventure
or anything like that 

just to get to stick around
for as long as I can 

eventually 
it will end 

eventually I will die 
and I won't know what happens afterward 

in the meantime 
I will keep writing things down 

and trying to be good for my family 
and I will look forward 

to whatever pizza 
and hamburgers are left 

and I will look forward to the cheese blintzes 
that go on sale 

when they are going to expire 
soon

I will promise one thing 
to you

I will go on sale 
before I expire 

and it will be the best sale 
you've ever seen 

in your 
life THE POINT

some days I don't get much writing done
not from a lack of effort 

it is something else, there is no reason 
it is just the way it goes 

I suppose I feel like going a bit easy on myself in the moment here
because I wasn't doing that throughout the day 

writing for the most part 
is a way of ironing out the confusion 

figuring out how you see things
one way or another 

if you think you've figured it out
you'll usually prove yourself wrong

and if you don't prove yourself wrong
you're probably missing the point 

I read some part of a book that was explaining what stakes are 
–– what happens if you get the thing, and what happens if you lose it 

the point it was making is that it's always both 
it can't just be one 

I suppose that stumped me throughout the day 
but it seems clear now 

get your family and find love 
or lose your family and find misery

well it seems I figured it out
so tomorrow, I'll try again 

and figure out 
what the point really is TABLE SAW

I have felt exhausted 
and frustrated 

steel wool 
brain 

but 
I caught a certain idea today 

something so idiotic 
that came from seemingly nowhere 

a guy running down the street 
with a massive erection and it getting sliced in half by a bandsaw 

it was a quick moment 
it was visceral and hilarious 

what a dumb ass thing to imagine 
what an amazing thing to imagine 

I spent the evening trying to make it into an animation 
on the computer

I will post it to YouTube 
when it is ready 

I changed it a bit 
he is on an escalator and there is a floating table saw instead of a bandsaw 

I suppose I feel less exhausted
and frustrated

having made
that cartoon 
TWO HUNDRED BUCKS

I am looking forward to 
tomorrow 

I am looking forward to drinking coffee
and frying up my eggs 

I will see what kind of ideas 
I can come up with 

I will go on a walk 
and I will read a book 

I will sit with my cat 
and 

I will look at my wife
and see that she is pregnant 

I know that the day will pass by quickly 
and then I will go to bed again 

one time a guy told me that he would throw me out of a car 
to make sure I wrote good poems 

I hope to never see that guy again 
and if he tries to throw me out of a car 

I will tell him that it is okay 
to write bad poems 

do not panic 
it is okay to write shit 

and by the way 
I bumped into a guy today 

that thinks I owe him two hundred bucks
he's still pissed 

but I don't owe him 
shit 

I said hi to him 
and he said hey 

the conversation ended there
he can bring it up if he wants 

but I already told him 
everything he needs to know 

I don't owe him
shit WILL SUFFICE

when I was cleaning out the snack cupboard today
I was feeling sad about death 

often I forget
as I’m sure most people do, that it is there 

I don’t know if I am as scared of it 
then I am sad about it 

I have been enjoying my time a lot
and I do not want to lose it 

I would like to keep getting the chance to go out to restaurants, 
to write, to watch youtube videos and spend time with my family 

this weekend we are debating going for falafels 
or pizza 

I would like to get both 
but my wife says one is enough and she is right 

I even ate three slices of pizza for dinner tonight when she was out 
but I still have an intense craving to order another one 

when I am going to die one day 
it will be sad to eat pizza for the last time 

in the meantime 
the only line of defence 

is to do as many things as I love doing 
as possible 

whatever you can get away with 
will suffice SMALL GARBAGE CAN

I am zoning out 
into a mood of strange joy 

I am pleased with the way 
today went 

I bought a small garbage can 
with a lid 

I will be happy to use it 
in the future 

I'm not sure what colour it is
tan or grey 

I would have to go downstairs 
and look 

it cost three dollars 
and I think it has a handle 

I forget 
I would have to go downstairs and look 

that little garbage can will be very helpful 
we will put all kinds of stuff in there 

I feel eternally grateful 
to that garbage can 

I am grateful that it will be itself 
first and foremost 

I am grateful that it will 
not bullshit anyone, including itself 

I am grateful that it will have the courage
to know the difference 

I am grateful that that little garbage can 
will be strong and stand up for what it believes in 

that garbage can 
is my hero 

I feel myself inspired 
to be like it 

it will be a symbol of stoicism and fortitude 
in our house HYPOTHETICAL VACATION

my wife told me
that it's time 

to trim down 
my beard

ok
I will do it 

tom-
-morrow 

before 
we go to costco 

I am trying to quiet my thoughts 
but they are moving quickly 

it makes it difficult to write
meaningfully 

I have a tooth ache 
we lost an hour to daylight savings 

we ate macaroni and cheese
for dinner 

I wouldn't mind 
being outside 

right 
now 

it is late
and snowing 

perhaps a walk through the woods 
is in order, tomorrow 

or perhaps 
we should fly somewhere where it is warm 

and sit near water
and film a home video 

about 
our vacation 

I will try to think of this hypothetical vacation
tomorrow 

when we are at 
costco 

when I am standing near the beef & chicken 
looking out in to the great beyond 

I WILL NOT BITE HIS TOE
in the middle of the night 
my cat bit my toe 

I woke up 
and yelled at him

I feel bad for getting so angry at him 
but you can't go and bite someone's toe when they're sleeping! 

somehow it makes me love him even more
when he does insane things like that 

even though 
I have been exhausted all day 

and fighting off 
the looming evil cloud 

on a day like this 
I can see the side of myself 

that gets 
chronically upset 

exercise helps 
art doesn't really 

art is what you do 
regardless 

exercise 
is medicine

art is
a symptom

it is as much the problem as it is the solution 
it cancels itself out 

I don't know if I believe that entirely 
it's usually foolish to make such a bold claim 

my cat is sleeping now 
in his tree, behind me 

I will not bite his toe 
–– instead 

I will wind down 
and go to bed also 
A LIFE OF DUST AND CRUMBS

I had a sudden realization 
that I could use the dust buster on my keyboard

and get 
all the crumbs out 

I went for it 
and now there are less crumbs 

the title of this poem 
will be 

a life of
dust and crumbs 

usually I don't pick the title until the end
but today is different 

earlier my wife helped me shave my neckline 
she went lower down than I usually would 

but it seems 
I look a bit more normal 

it is hard to know where to trim the bottom of your beard
so that it doesn't look weird 

I also have a lot of nose hairs 
and ear hairs 

I am learning 
there are different way of dealing with them 

there is something to be said for all of these machines
dust busters and electric shavers and stuff like that 

I don't know exactly what there is to be said for them 
but surely, 

it seems
that there is something to be said THE DOG WITH HIS TAIL TIED IN A KNOT

I was walking back from the subway 
and I saw 

this dog 
with his tail tied in a knot 

a woman was trying to help him 
but she couldn’t fix it 

some other guy was also trying to help 
he tugged at the knot with all his might

but he couldn't get it loose 
and he said that the worst had come

the man said that there was no choice left
he was going to cut the dog's tail off

the man could not stand 
the knot 

it was driving him off the wall
he was losing his mind over the dog's knotted tail 

he went to get the sheers from his garage 
and then 

the man realized 
that the dog's tail was not in a knot 

he realized that the woman was not there
and he realized 

that I was not there either 
he realized that he was staring at a normal dog 

and then 
the man screamed until his head exploded

and that 
is when I saw the dog 

with the knotted tail 
running up the street 

when I was walking back
from the subway I MAY BE UNSPOOLED YARN

I often feel close
to failure 

perhaps 
my days spent at my desk 

are nothing 
but an attempt at defence 

against 
that 

rather than 
an aim to succeed 

avoiding failure 
rather than 

aiming 
to succeed 

I find it hard to imagine 
that feeling successful 

is at the core 
of anyone's being 

this may be a gross miscalculation on my end 
or it may not be 

I may not be practicing 
well

I may be unspooled 
yarn 

I know that there is calmness at the bottom of it all 
but it takes a lot of practice to burn off the panic and the dread 

and I am busy 
doing my work!

playing chicken 
moving towards failure 

standing near failure 
unspooling the yarn I AM DRINKING DIET COKE

the wind is creaking the house 
and I am sitting near the shabbat candles 

the dishwasher is going
my cat is resting 

I am glad I am not dead 
I have a lot to look forward to 

I did not always feel that way 
I needed to learn how 

I am drinking diet coke
and my sock is on the rug THREE WAYS OF CARING

there are three ways of caring 
about what other people think 

that I can think of
at the moment 

appearance ––  
ear hairs, double chin, dandruff 

personality –– 
annoying, intense, dumb 

choices –– 
the art you make, how you invest, what toothbrush you bought

I have been insecure 
about all of these categories 

at some point 
or another 

they come and go 
depending on whatever 

...I no longer want to be insecure 
about the art I make 

I don't know if that insecurity has been as clear to me 
as it is now 

that I have framed it 
this way 

abracadabra 
alakazam 

ok
it's done 

I will never be insecure about the art I make 
again 

it doesn't matter 
what anyone thinks 

there is cat shit 
smeared on the canvas 

fuck you
:)  SOME THOUGHTS ON WRITING

when you write all day 
it may seem
like there is nothing left to write

when you do not write all day 
it may seem also 
like there is nothing to write 

there is always another thing
to write
and if you feel like you cannot write anymore, then just write something down anyway 

in your notebook
on your keyboard
in the sand 

if there is a wave
and it washes away what you have written 
it is good to feel the pain of it 

throw your notebook in the fire
highlight everything and delete it and then empty the computer trash 
it doesn't matter 

and if your handwriting is illegible  
it's probably for the best 
it doesn't matter

senselessly write the next thing 
when you have no ideas left
and when you have no ideas at all UNLIMITED DEBT

I ate
an apple 

earlier 
today 

my wife had cut into quarters 
and put it in a plastic bag 

and gave me 
it

if ever 
I lose sight 

of how lucky I am 
to have her give me a bag of apple slices 

I deserve to be 
hung 

in the town square
for everyone to see 

"his wife gave him a bag of apple slices 
and he didn't care"

"absolutely he deserved to die 
for that" 

"no 
question" 

"fuck 
him"

lose sight of that
and your life has no value 

your art 
and your money and all of that shit becomes unlimited debt 

you can owe unlimited debt 
with your shit value 

or 
you can owe unlimited debt

to the person 
who gives you apple slices 

quartered
in a plastic bag 
SHARK STORY

I am imagining a worm 
and a particle of dust

I am thinking about confidence 
and fear 

I am wearing a t-shirt 
and sitting in a chair 

I am looking at the keyboard
and the screen 

a shark once bit off
my penis 

I don't talk about it 
often

it is
what it is 

I am a bit hungry
I think I will go downstairs for a snack

in
a bit 
GLUE

I have not been reading as much 
lately 

instead I have been writing in my notebook 
a lot 

I will have to adjust my thinking 
because 

if you don’t read
you become a piece of shit 

life just isn’t 
as good 

the stories on hbo 
are damn good

but somehow 
even the best tv just isn’t the same 

it’s synthetic protein 
–– still protein, but not the top shelf stuff 

I will have to glue my ass to a couch this weekend 
and get back on track 
MY LAST WILL

I am happy to write 
internet poems 

when I die 
I will download them all onto a usb chip 

and bring them
into my coffin 

I don't know why 
I think that is a good idea

it's just what I have decided
to do 
SIMPLE MEGAPHONE

I hope to make things simple 
but that is difficult 

it is very complicated 
to make things simple 

people say they want to –– keep 
things simple 

but I don't think they realize 
how it works 

the complications must be worked out 
in order for things to be simple 

perhaps there is something more interesting 
that I'm not telling you at the moment 

yesterday when I was walking 
down the street 

I imagined the prime minister farting into a pylon 
and thinking it was a megaphone 

I think people would like him more
if he did that 

truthfully 
the world would love him for that 

surely you see what I mean 
about working through the complications 

if only he could focus 
enough 

to do what I described... 
–– things would become simple 10.99 2 ITEM COMBO (WITH RICE OR NOODLES AND CHOICE OF SOUP)

we were at the grocery store today
buying stuff 

there was a hot bar there 
where they had all this chinese food 

we got the two item combo with rice and a soup for 10.99 
to share 

the woman ahead of us said 
"give me the biggest container of won ton soup that you have" 

after we ordered 
Miriam asked me if I was going to write about it later

I said no
and at the time, I meant it

but here I am 
writing about it 

we sat and enjoyed the food 
a homeless person sat beside us, eating soup or something 

a guy walked by with his dog
and some other woman was filming another woman who was sitting on the ground for some reason 

there isn't much else to say about it 
but I was very happy to eat lunch together 

to have some time 
to sit and enjoy a chinese food combo 

with your wife
surrounded by groceries...

I don't know how to explain it 
without sounding hyperbolic 

but –– 
that's the maximum 

I will look forward to having the chance to go back there one day 
maybe when our daughter is born 

we can take her 
there
DEAR INTERNET POEM

mother fucker
writing is a bitch 

the last two days have been fucked
I haven't got jack shit done 

sometimes 
every time you try to write 

you just fuck up your shit 
badly 

because you have no idea 
what the fuck you're doing 

you have to be willing and able to write complete shit 
to move forward 

it is so fucked
–– dealing with shit 

tomorrow 
in the morning 

I will look at what I did today
and 

I will try to get it right 
but for now 

it's so fucked
it's so fucking fucked 

thank you for listening 
dear internet poem 

truly 
I am grateful 

that you are here for me 
every day 

no matter what happens 
with the other shit 

you
dear internet poem 

never fail me 
you are my best friend (and my cat) 

thank you for everything 
dear internet poem 

yours truly, 
JHB
IN HAND

I have been living 
strangely 

the past 
few days 

I am in the rabbit hole 
of trying to figure out this project

throwing matches on piles of gasoline 
there are big flames but they burn out quickly 

but there is always a little chanukah flame 
somewhere you can't see 

and the elements are there
wind, rain all that shit 

and you need to handle it 
or else it will slowly burn you alive 

you will feel smoke in your lungs 
and your stomach will be on fire 

you will have silent 
shocking farts

I am trying to tell the story 
of the idiot tree 

I don't know what that means 
I am just following it 
 
despite how frustrated and irritated I have felt 
I think I am beginning to understand it 

the vision of it 
seems to be here 

you might be wondering 
what you are supposed to do 

when you eventually find this proverbial candle 
and I will tell you 

you have to stick the flame 
up your pee hole 

there is no way around it 
it is the only way to smother the fire 

if you do not do it
it will destroy everything 

your mind, your house
and everything you love 

so here I am 
dick in hand 

staring at the flame 
trying to build up the courage 

to do 
the thing SPRING FEVER

lately 
I have felt on fire 

in my stomach 
and my thoughts are grinding 

when the snow melts after the winter
a lot of things are all rusted  

I feel like a rusted bike gear 
or something 

I am happy that the air is warming 
with the spring 

but 
the spring has a strange evil to it 

what I want right now...
I suppose –– 

I would like to go sit in the woods 
I would like to be near a pine tree and some kind of river

I would like to sit quietly 
with my cat 

it is true 
that I find people exhausting 

and it is good
to be alone 

when it is time
to be 

–– 
alone MIX PACK

the mix pack 
of pudding cups

chocolate
vanilla 

and 
caramel 

they are 
there

they represent 
all that there is 

all that there was
and all

that there ever will 
be

whatever you do 
do not 

look 
at the expiry date

that is all I can say 
for now 

it is not a matter of anything 
it's just what it is 

it is the truth of the matter
and

they are 
thereTHINKING ABOUT POEMS

the point of writing a poem is to find a way to describe something that you are not capable of describing unless you write a poem
a good poem describes something you know but don’t have the ability to explain

a good poem describes an idea that cannot be described without warping ordinary speech 

a good poem must be idiotic, wrong and weird. It must be cheap 

a good poem should be written and read without much effort 

a meal becomes poetic when it becomes something more than the sum total of its ingredients 

if you go to a restaurant and eat a slice of pizza and it reminds you of a time twenty years ago when you were at swimming lessons — the slice has become poetic

you cannot explain how that moment felt but you experience it briefly from eating the pizza slice 

I know that the logic of what I’m saying doesn’t track completely 

and that’s ok

I told you it needs to be idiotic, wrong and weird 

so I have done what I intended 
A REAL FRIEND

I talked to my friend 
this morning

we talked things 
over

it was worth it to be honest 
with one another 

and now we are on the same page 
again 

a real friend 
will not act like a little bitch 

in the face 
of conflict

a real friend 
will hear you out 

and know 
that you are trying to sort things out

you don't get many real friends 
in life 

sometimes 
you tell them what you think 

and they reveal themselves to be 
commie bastards 

and sometimes 
you tell them what you think 

and they think 
that you're the commie bastard 

but 
I suppose 

we are all commie bastards 
at heart

do not be afraid 
to be a stubborn prick 

when the time 
is right

because if you are not that 
then you are not anything 

a real friend 
will know what you're saying 

and it will be 
all good 
CONFLATE EVERYTHING

a crumb
on the ground

next to 
a pool of slime 

***

sometimes 
you begin to say a new word 

and you feel smart
but people know 

that you are saying 
a new word 

the word lately for me 
has been –– conflate 

do not conflate the pop can tab
with the recycling bin 

do not conflate the crumb on the ground 
with the pool of slime 

***

as I was walking earlier 
I was thinking about some stuff 

–– how you do one thing 
is how you do everything ––

it is indisputably and undoubtably 
true 

so
at the end of the day 

I suppose we have no other choice 
than 

to
conflate everything 
I HOPE DAVE IS ALRIGHT

it was an unproductive day 
today 

I have been battling 
some kind of weird sickness 

my brain feels dizzy 
and somehow electrified 

I may have melted my mind 
from being on the computer too much 

I have tried to stick to my notebook
and library book

but I am addicted to this machine 
I am a slug who has being struck by lightning 

***

one time in junior high 
a fight broke out

between the grade eights
and the grade nines 

I was riding my skateboard
and grabbed a pizza pop off the ground 

I tossed it at this guy Wade
and at the same time he tossed a slurpee at my head 

I wonder if I got brain damage 
and it is finally catching up to me 

my friend Dave got a garbage can beat onto his head that day too
hopefully he's alrightDUE IN TWO MONTHS

I was sick 
since last Saturday 

but I am feeling better 
today

sometimes when you are sick 
it seems like you might die 

I got to thinking 
that in ten years 

my kid 
will only be ten 

that made me feel 
pretty young 

I am happy knowing 
that I am going to live 

I am thinking of what I am looking forward to 
living for 

and
the thing I am most excited about 

is having a baby
she is due in two monthsSUN LEFT

I would like to go for a walk 
in the park 

but instead I am sitting here 
looking at my hand

I should have gone earlier 
but now it's almost dinnertime  

so I will have to go 
after we eat 

***

last night, when we were watching tv before bed
I became hungry 

I went downstairs 
and there were a lot of boiled eggs left over from the passover seder 

I microwaved one  
and when I bit into it –– it exploded all over the cabinet and the counter and the ground

I know that sounds like something I would make up
but it happened 

*** 

if you have a hard boiled egg
you should put it in the microwave

if it doesn't explode there
it will explode when you take a bite out of it 

it will burn your tongue 
and seems quite dangerous 

but 
it was craziest thing that's happened to me in a long time 

***

I am looking forward to eating dinner 
I have become very hungry 

thinking about 
that exploding egg 

I am looking forward to going on a walk 
after we eat 

I hope that there is some sun left
when we goHOW TO BE GOOD

if something is good
then it is good

if it is not good
then it is not good 

people will like it 
if it is good 

people will not like it
if it is not good

people are dumb
often 

and you are also 
a dumb person often 

if you are not a dumb person 
often enough 

you will become 
not good 

if you are dumb 
often 

you will be 
good 

become as dumb
as possible 

and then you will be 
good

do not become dumb
and you will remain not goodCOLIC AT THIRTY FIVE

I hadn't been feeling like myself
these past few weeks 

the truth is 
I still have colic at age thirty five  

but I had a better day today 
than I have in a little while

I read 98 pages
of the baby book 

I have been procrastinating reading it
for over a month 

but now that I've gotten into it
I am feeling better

if I do the same tomorrow and the day afterward 
I will have finished the book

and then I will know 
what there is to know 

about calming down 
a crying baby 

afterward 
I should read a book about 

what happens when my wife goes into labour
and I need to drive us to the hospital 

and know what to do 
while she is giving birth 

to 
our baby I FINALLY READ THE BABY BOOK

I finally read 
the baby book 

I procrastinated and 
renewed it three times 

that is the maximum 
amout of times you are allowed to renew a book 

and then I 
binged it in the last two days 

it is due 
tomorrow 

but I did it
and now I feel like less of a pussy ass bitch 

I know what colic is now 
and I have some ideas as to how to soothe a crying baby 

I was thinking of buying some burritos
to practice swaddling 

but I thought maybe that wouldn't be the best idea 
in case

I end up 
eating the baby 

***

tomorrow I will take the book back 
to the library 

and I will try to find 
another one WINDEXING

I thought of writing long sentences here 
like the ones in my journal 

but 
somehow 

it seems impossible 
to do 

I don't know why 
I have the urge to write long sentences and paragraphs 

maybe 
because it is a serious thing to do 

and it is great
to be serious 

but it is also 
incredibly dumb 

a serious person
will windex the bathroom mirror

a serious person 
will not accidentally sneeze on the bathroom mirror after windexing it 

they would cover their mouth 
and not get it all over the place 

they may even hit their head against the cabinet 
as they try to avert their face away from the mirror that they have just windex'd

they may crack their head open 
and become permanently injured and even die 

an unserious person 
may have to windex the mirror twice 

they will look at their reflection 
and see themselves covered in snot 

there is a third possibility 
to consider

imagine that you windex'd the mirror 
and then sneezed on the mirror 

and whacked your head against the cabinet
and cracked your head open 

it is the best of both 
worlds

I know that I veered off into serious bullshit 
with this whole mirror thing 

but 
it is very difficult to hold back a sneeze 

they say you should look at the light 
but I have tried

and 
it doesn't work NOTES ON WISHING

we picked up two pizzas
on the way home 

from taking our cat
to the vet, he has been struggling lately 

after we ate the pizzas 
we walked around the park 

we are trying to take some extra pictures 
of Miriam 

to make sure we have some good ones
so that one day we can remember how she looked, when she was pregnant 

***

we just heard a loud crashing sound 
and went downstairs to see what it was

our cat knocked over an important plate 
it is the one that Miriam's mom uses to put the shabbat candles on each week

it is shattered now
it is broken into many pieces 

...I became hungry 
while we were downstairs cleaning up 

and now I am eating an apple 
and feeling guilty 

***

I will say one more thing
while I am here

I will admit that
when I see the clock at 11:11

I cannot help but make a wish 
it feels involuntary, like a reflex 

and every time 
I end up wishing for the same thing 

I wish for my family
to be okay 

***

I don't know why 
wishing seems dumb 

I try to wish 
as little as possible

perhaps 
it is just a matter of general goal setting

and maybe if I organized those thoughts a bit more
they wouldn't be so desperate to jump at clocks

and 
magic numbers 
WE ARE GOING TO COSTCO ON MONDAY NIGHT

I am hoping to get chicken fingers 
from costco soon 

I hope I can go there at a time 
when it isn't so busy 

so I can eat
in peace

I hope to have extra dipping sauces 
and extra ketchup

I hope to have some fries 
and a soda 

a ginger ale 
or diet coke 

I don't really care
actually, maybe ginger ale 

there isn't much else
I feel like doing 

we probably don't have time to go
until monday night 

I will look forward to it 
until then 
BROWN PANTS

lately 
I have felt like owning a pair of dark brown pants 

I used to have a pair like that 
a long time ago 

I don't know what happened to them 
I must have left them behind somewhere 

I don't know why 
I became fixated on the idea 

this happens sometimes
I get fixated on wanting to own something trivial 

maybe the idea will fade off
or maybe I will just have to go out and buy a pair of pants like that 

I know how pointless it will be 
to own another pair of pants

though maybe they would be good to own 
if I ever shit myself 

maybe if I wear them while writing 
I will be able to finish a novel at a disturbingly fast pace 

next weekend 
my wife said that she wanted to go value village 

when we are there 
I will look and see 

if they have any pants
like the ones I am picturing 

and if they don't 
then I will not own brown pants like that 

that is all I can say
for now 
CONSIDERING SALAMI

we bought a thing of kosher salami 
that I am excited about eating in the coming days 

perhaps I will have a salami sandwich 
or have it for breakfast with some eggs

Miriam wants to have it on a bagel 
on the weekend 

my mother in law already had a few slices
while she was watching tv 

I will see if my cat wants to try some
and maybe we will give a bit to the dogs too

sometimes I get hungry before bed
and if I do, I will go down to the fridge and slice off a piece 

we are making pizza tomorrow night for dinner 
and I even suggested we make one with salami on it 

*** 

while I was writing this
I have been watching my cat 

he spent twenty minutes trying to get his feather toy from under the closet door 
and he finally got it 

now 
he is dragging it around and kicking it and biting it 

he worked very hard
and now he is enjoying the fruits of his labour 

without the hunt 
he is miserable 

I did the math 
and I think it took me ten minutes of work to get the salami 

but that doesn't account for the time it took me to park the car, find the salami in the store, pay for it and drive home
so it seems that we earn similarly, me and my cat –– it evens out in the end THINGS IN THE WORLD

there are many things
in the world 

and 
I suppose I do not care about a lot of them 

it is a luxury 
not having to care 

it is a luxury 
to get to chose what you care about

I care about 
watching hbo 

writing 
and my wife and cat 

and 
my daughter who my wife is carrying 

as I am writing this 
I think they are doing yoga in the other room 

we will watch hbo soon 
after I brush my teeth 

and shut down my computer 
for the night

in the morning 
I will write again 

I will go for a walk 
and make some money from teaching some things to film students 

I will put that money in the bank and for the most part 
we will spend it on food and baby stuff 

there are many things in the world
and as you can see –– my world is very small 

I think I am well suited 
for that I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE COMPUTER SCREEN

I have been looking at the computer screen 
for many, many hours today 

it happens most days
of my life 

but somehow
in this moment, my eyes feel like they have becomes screens themselves 

it seems as they are emitting 
their own brightness 

this does not happen 
after a day of reading 

or writing 
in a notebook

tomorrow 
I will spend some time 

with my notebook
and an actual book 

hopefully it is cloudy 
so my eyes can rest 

I wonder if eyeballs 
are made out of lightning bolts 

or 
if they are the same as stars 

it is all just 
different kinds of light 

I don't actually wonder that 
I guess I am just thinking about it in a weird way 

not to be clever
or odd

but because it is enjoyable 
to doA CUP HOLDS WATER

I am feeling 
slightly like

there is wet concrete 
in the front of my brain 

I am still thinking about form 
and what it means 

there are different form genres 
if something needs to be 

watched in one hour 
or contained to a frameable square 

if there must be groups of two short lines
that fill roughly a page 

if it must be a two or three minute
song 

I can see what Knausgard was saying 
about how important it is

a cup holds water
a house keeps us dry from the rain 

my brain now feels like
it is a baked potato wrapped in tinfoil 

I think I will go downstairs
and get an apple

that has been my favourite snack
lately WE'RE GOOD

as I walked into the street today 
I saw a guy who thinks I'm a bastard

I said hello to him, as I have done before
but he could bring himself to say hello back

it causes him too much pain 
to say hello 

I suppose he isn't the only guy 
who would feel unable to say hello to me 

if they saw me
in the street 

I think at this point it is better to accept it and move on 
then to wonder about it 

the qualms are minor
in the grand scheme

I would be fine to talk these things out 
but I don't think that is what people always want

if you don't resolve the conflict
you can keep it 

it can be yours
forever

it will never abandon you
not like in the way that I did 

these fuckin pussies! 
get a life 

I don't need to be someone
that everyone likes

I am thinking of the people that think I'm a piece of shit 
I am imagining them hanging out 

maybe if I came by 
they would say, okay man, you can hang out with us 

here's a diet coke 
we're good
CONSIDERING SALAMI II

simultaneously I am sitting in my chair 
and I am drinking a sip of water

simultaneously I am giving a fuck
and I am not giving a fuck 

each week
passes

and there is a lot of bad shit that happens
and nothing goes wrong 

my favourite food 
at the moment 

is kosher salami 
from costco 

especially if you fry it
in a cast iron pan 

I should think of sharing it
instead of trying to keep it all for myself 

I am simultaneously giving a fuck
and not giving a fuck 

I am sitting in my chair
and simultaneously drinking a sip of waterDOG EARED THING

I enjoyed sitting on the subway today
and reading a book I got from the library 

the person who had the book before me
left in this strange bookmark 

it is a little cheap brass looking thing 
a paperclip with an arrow, some kind of dog ear 

I thought it was ingenious at first 
because you could mark exactly which line you left off on

when my stop was coming up
I tried to move the damn thing 

but I dropped it twice
when I was trying to clip it onto the line 

and then I kept fidgeting with it 
to get it right on the line 

it was so finicky 
I almost missed my stop 

it was a complete debacle 
I almost had a full breakdown

usually I use a post it note 
as a bookmark 

and starting tomorrow 
I'm going back to them

after what happened on the subway today 
after almost losing my page and missing my stop like that 

I'm never trusting that dog eared thing 
ever again HIS KINDNESS WAS UNPARALLELED

I have a strange feeling
in my stomach 

I was downstairs 
eating salt and vinegar chips 

and then I ate
an apple

I feel calm 
and exhausted

but there is some lingering anxiety 
about something I can't quite place

we had to say goodbye to Jag today
he was Miriam's mom's cat 

I gave him a pat on the head 
for the last time 

his kindness was unparalleled 
he loved to sit on the porch in the sun 

he stood up for our cat
when the dogs would chase him 

he would come stomping towards them
and send them back cowering 

he always stood up 
for the little guy 

even when the little guy
would pounce on him and tackle him for no reason

I saw him
lying in the sun, the day before he got sick

it would have been the last time 
he got to do that 

he will be missed
here at our house 

his kindness 
was unparalleled 

rest in peace
old buddyAPPLE

sometimes, when I don't know what to write
I compulsively go on youtube

I scroll through the videos
and see what's going on 

I just watched a video 
but already, for the life of me I cannot remember what it was 

truly,
I cannot remember 

perhaps I ate too much jalapeño 
at dinner 

perhaps I need to go downstairs 
and eat an apple

I will go do that
one moment 

***

I have returned 
and now I am eating an apple 

I cut it into four slices 
and gave one to Miriam 

she is sick in bed 
and watching youtube with a tissue sticking out of her nose 

I see our cat 
is drinking some water

everyone is relaxing here
we are winding down for the night 

–– god damn it 
I went on youtube again

I didn't even know I was doing it 
I suppose I'll pack it in for the night too SITTING OUTSIDE

I am here 
eating apple slices again 

I was able to read my book 
on the porch, today 

I sat there
and my cat walked around looking at stuff 

I enjoyed the book 
but more so, I felt content sitting there with him and the book and the sun

it is possible 
that it could be the last time 

it is unlikely that it will be the last time 
but it is possible 

like yesterday 
I am here eating apple slices again 

and tomorrow
I hope we can sit outside again, even for ten or fifteen minutes

we will think of our old buddy
who knew better than anyone 

what it meant
to sit in the sunI FORGOT ABOUT IT UNTIL NOW

tomorrow 
I will anticipate 

going on 
a

long 
walk 

I will anticipate 
seeing trees

and stuff
like that

I will anticipate 
reading a book 

***

today 
when I was walking 

I saw an old woman sitting 
on a chair 

outside 
of starbucks

she was staring 
blankly 

she was taking a moment 
to think 

things 
over

***

I was overwhelmed 
briefly 

I was reminded of the times 
I sat and stared blankly like that

thinking things over
trying to put it all together

I saw myself in that old
woman

and I choked up 
a bit

and then I kept walking 
and forgot about it until now MOBILE

we set a bassinet up
at the edge of the bed 

it is comforting to see
it 

the baby will go in there
and she will look at the ceiling 

we will need to get her
the right mobile 

for now
she will stay 

in her mother's 
womb 

I can only imagine 
what strange mobiles 

she has been looking at 
in there 

I was just speaking to my mother 
on the phone 

I don't remember 
anything 

from my time 
in the womb

I don't remember 
my bassinet

or any 
mobiles

I don't even remember
my first memory

I am sitting here 
trying to remember

but I'm really 
not sureTHE FUTURE

I am looking forward 
to waking up tomorrow 

and going on 
my morning walk 

lately 
it has become my favourite thing to do 

I set my alarm 
thirty minutes earlier 

to be closer 
to the sunrise 

I will continue this habit 
as I go into the future 

***
in the future 
I will have a new book to share 

in the future
I will hold my daughter and show her the sun and the clouds

in the future 
I will go to the library with my daughter and she will pick out a book to read

in the future
I will be scratching my head and standing in the middle of nowhere near some dirt and patches of grass

in the future 
I will be wearing a strange pair of sneakers 

in the future 
I will write something down in my notebookI WILL FIND SOME MUD TO STAND IN

I would like to go
out of the city 

sometime
soon

I would like to go
stand

in the trees
and the mud

I may not get the chance 
this weekend 

but maybe 
next weekend 

I can go 
drive somewhere 

like
that 

in the meantime 
I will go to the park 

near 
our house 

I will try to find 
a strange path 

to walk
down

I will try to find 
a strange tree

to look 
at

I will find some mud 
to stand in

and I will look
at my shoes

as they sink
into the mud
I KEPT GOING AHEAD WITH THINGS

I am thinking 
of my stomach 

that is where the strangeness 
usually is 

it is usually 
prickly and acidic 

not always 
but a lot of the time 

in a way 
it is like it controls my thoughts

it makes them move 
quickly 

it is difficult to relax
for me

instead
I would rather focus on something 

like writing
or editing 

I don't think I will overcome it
I don't think that I want to 

I can remember it 
since I was a kid 

I left class
and went to the office

and told them 
I had a stomach ache 

but I knew 
I couldn't explain it right 

so I kept going 
ahead with things 

I think of all of the times 
sitting at a keyboard

or with a pencil 
and a notebook 

still trying to explain it 
some days are better than others 

I know I will never get to the bottom of it
but that is okay 

I will keep going 
ahead 

with 
things BREAKING A STICK IN HALF

I wanted to write about going to get my hair cut
today 

it went 
well

usually I just cut my hair at home
but for some reason, this time I wanted to go to a place

Sam's Barber Shop
next to the Pet Valu 

he did a great job
I would like to go back one day 

I walked through the park 
on the way home 

I found a stick on the ground 
and snapped it in half

and then tossed it 
into a puddle 

it felt good to break the stick in half 
for no reason 

it doesn't affect anything
if you break a stick in half

I will go back to the park 
and break another stick like that 

again 
one day 
I AM SENTIMENTAL TO IT

sometimes 
when you write

you sit
and do nothing 

like
now

I am sitting
here in my chair 

looking at weird markings
on my desk 

without even realizing
that I'm doing it 

I just cut a thread 
off of my wallet 

I then stood up 
and walked around my office here

I may have looked out the window
it was a blur

now I am sitting again 
and I read some messages from my wife

she is on her way home from work now
I am telling her how our cat was this afternoon 

I have noticed that I have become 
sentimental 

about 
sitting with a notebook and being not sure what to write

when I look back 
I am happy that this is how I spent my life 

I looked up the word
sentimental 

"of or prompted by feelings of
tenderness, sadness or nostalgia" 

ok
that is fine

I am sentimental 
to it LIME SPARKLING WATER

I have a can of sparkling water
there is a lime twist to it 

I am happy to be drinking
this soda

I am here sitting at my desk
enjoying a soda pop

I am thinking of the future
anticipating what is to come 

I am looking forward 
to having time 

to 
focus

in this moment
I have time

to 
focus

but somehow
I am wondering about tomorrow 

and wondering if I will have time
to drink a soda

and sit at my desk
and

focus
on doing a bit of writing 

I don't have a solution
it is the way it goes 

it is
what 

it 
is CONSIDERING FAMILY

it is strange 
to have family 

to me
nothing has been as strange 

as
that

I am not great 
at it 

siblings
and siblings in law

aunts
and uncles 

all that shit 
I'm not good at it 

for the most part
I feel like I cannot be myself 

around
family 

for the most part 
I feel misunderstood and criticized 

for the most part
I feel that I misunderstand and criticize

I am unsure
about it all 

I am having a family of my own 
soon

I will try to make sure that my daughter feels ok
about it all 

even if I am unable 
I hope that she will TOMORROW AFTERNOON

I was just feeding my cat
and making sure

that 
he had his medication

now 
I am looking forward to getting some rest

I will watch some tv
and then

I will close my eyes
and 

eventually 
I will fall asleep

with the window 
open 

tonight
I am so exhausted 

that I have remembered
how much of a luxury it is

to have
a bed 

and
a roof 

the reason I am so tired
is that we were up very late last night

talking 
about

family 
stuff

***

tomorrow afternoon 
we are going to costco

I am looking forward to it being 
less busy there

than 
usual 

I am looking forward to getting some food
for 

our 
fridge 

I am looking forward 
to being there

tomorrow 
afternoon

but for now
I will get

some 
sleep 
THE GRASS WILL STAND UPWARD

each day 
a different thing happens 

I don't know 
if I have anything else to say about that 

instead 
I will sit here patiently 

the screen glowing 
on my face in the dark 

tomorrow 
a different thing will happen 

the sun will go 
on a tree 

and a cloud will go
across the sky 

there will be many bugs 
in the grass

and the grass 
will stand upward

as 
it does HOW IT WENT

I went to the library 
earlier this afternoon 

I went 
to drop off some books 

and 
I picked up a new one

I already read thirty pages of it 
when I got home 

I am happy that I got 
it 

you never know 
which book will grab your attention 

I am hoping to read more
tomorrow 

when I take the subway 
downtown 

***

for dinner 
we cooked some salmon on the barbecue 

and some potatoes 
and made a salad

we ate it 
outside 

under 
the sun 

now I am sitting 
here at my desk

remembering 
the afternoon 

and how
it went 

***

I forgot to mention 
when I was at the library 

they gave me a new card
because mine was so worn out

that it wouldn't even scan
into the machine

any -- 
moreBASEBALL GAME

we are going to the baseball game
I will return later and describe how it went 

***

I enjoyed sitting there
watching the game 

many of the innings came and went 
without advancing the score

while I sat
I thought of the book I have been reading 

the feeling of the book and its messages 
remained 

sometimes I caught myself staring at nothing
I'm sure from the outside it looked like I was focused on the game

but often I was floating in the ether 
lost in thought 

it was good to go 
to the baseball game

even though 
we got home a bit later than I would have liked I WILL NOTICE THE NEXT ROCK I SEE

I swept along the garage 
cleaning out the old leaves 

I found a cheese 
stick thing

I found a green circle thing
I found an enter key 

now
when I walk along the garage 

I am happy to see
the rocks

it is good to clean things up
and get them into a way that you are happy with 

then you can appreciate them
in a new way 

and you can see the rocks 
better

I have always liked rocks
they are unbelievable 

they are powerful
they are everywhere 

I will look forward to the next time 
I see a rock 

I will notice 
the next rock I see 
CONTINUING

I am happy that things are going
the way that they are

I am able to write a poem like this
each day

I am able to record videos on my camera 
each day

I am able to spend time with my cat and my wife
each day

our car is running well 
and the weather has become warm 

I am writing as good of poems 
as I ever need to

I am making as good of videos 
as I ever need to 

now 
all there is to do 

is 
to continue REMAIN INTERESTED

I am not sure that I am interested in writing about anything that is interesting 

I am not sure that I am interested in writing anything intelligent 

I am more interested in something else 

I am not sure what it is 

if I was sure what it is I would likely become disinterested in it 

I am interested in making things without thinking about them 

it makes it difficult to feel comfortable

but that is great

sometimes I think that I should change 

but it is impossible 

and instead 

each day 

I have to continue 

to learn 

confidence 

***

the way to learn confidence 

is to remain interested –– 

and to be honest with yourself 

about what 

you are interested

in 
THE INJURY

when I was sweeping up the leaves 
last weekend 

I got a blister on the bottom of 
my thumb 

the skin peeled upward 
in a strange way 

each day the skin has grown back 
a small amount 

it is impossible to understand
how skin understands 

what 
to do 

how does it know
how to grow the right amount 

to cover up
the injury 

it seems impossible 
to think 

that it knows
because 

I 
know 

but it must be
that exact reason 

it is impossible to understand
that you are also your body 

more accurately 
I should phrase it differently 

it is impossible to understand 
that I am also my body 

I will try not to think too much 
about it 

the best thing to do 
is probably 

to make sure 
to keep doing exercise 

that is understanding 
enough 
TELEPATHIC LIPOSUCTION

I sat at my desk
for most of the day 

I had the discipline 
to sit

but I did not have
focus 

it seems as though 
I accomplished nothing

I need liposuction 
telepathically 

or 
telepathic liposuction 

I tried walking it off
–– I went to the library 

I drank espresso 
next to traffic 

I tried to be there 
but I was somewhere else 

somewhere 
between the coffee heat and the exhaust 

I spent the rest of the afternoon 
processing my confusion 

in my journal 
while sitting with my cat outside 

afterward I read some chapters of a book 
I was fascinated by them 

but still 
I felt embittered 

about 
myself 

I know that tomorrow 
at a certain point –– it will shift 

and I will feel 
more like myself 

but I suppose 
I had a difficult time

getting there 
today AT SOME OTHER TIME EARLIER

I don't always know 
what is going on 

in
the world 

today 
for instance 

we went
to eat ice cream 

and I didn't know about 
anything

except
the ice cream

that 
we were eating 

one scoop was vanilla 
and the other scoop 

was some fruit 
kind 

it was mango 
or passion fruit 

or something 
like that 

we were eating the ice cream
and I didn't even know what flavour it was 

now I am sitting here
near the window 

I am looking at the black sky 
and the shadows

I suppose 
that there are also street lights there 

going along 
the road 

I don't know much else
about the world

even the moon 
is nowhere to be found 

even the moon 
is trying to remember 

what kind of ice cream 
it was eating 

at some other time
earlier A ROOM THAT STRANGERS WILL ENTER

it is difficult 
to learn 

how to gain 
confidence 

I think
that I have gotten better at it 

I got better at it
because I tried 

to get better
at it 

now that I have some confidence 
I am hoping to share my work with more people 

I think that there are people out there 
that will like my work 

I would be happy for that connection 
to be made 

***

I am thinking of a time 
when I visited home

my mom had an art show
at a coffee shop

I was lucky to be there 
to help her set up all of her paintings 

mostly 
they were paintings of flowers 

I saw 
that it takes courage

to put your pictures up
in a room 

that strangers
will enter 

I will have to now think 
of invitationsTHINGS ARE NOT SOLELY THE WAY THAT THEY ARE

it is good to go 
to a remote place 

when you are there
it may feel normal 

but when you return
to the place you ordinarily are 

it will be good 
to have been

in 
the remote place 

***

it is easy to forget
that things 

are not solely 
the way 

that
they are 

***

I would recommend 
that you pack an apple

and 
a bottle of water

and a camera
in case you want to take a picture 

of a cloud 
or a tree 

that you 
notice 

***

because it is easy 
to forget 

that things are not 
solely 

the way 
that they are 
MY GRAND AMBITION

my grand ambition 
is

to one day
have a small cabin 

in
the woods

to walk through the trees 
and notice a strange bird 

to own 
a firearm 

in case
necessary 

to write something down 
in my notebook

and never return 
to what I had written 

to see 
the snow and the leaves and the pollen 

and the sun
and the moon

and all of that 
stuff 

it is a good thing
to think of 

for 
one day 

it is a good thing 
to think of

for 
eventually 
HAVING EATEN MCDONALDS

I am not wondering 
about much

I am sitting 
this evening 

having eaten mcdonalds 
for supper 

enjoying 
each bite 

very 
much 

I would like to always have the chance
to enjoy mcdonalds

every 
now 

and 
again 

to eat some fries 
and ketchup

a hamburger 
and ketchup 

some chicken 
and soda 

ice cream
coffee

all that stuff 
that they have 

it is all 
great

I have always loved 
going to mcdonalds ADVICE TO MY YOUNGER SELF

it is good 
to be busy

with something
you care about 

what you need to do 
is practice 

caring 
about

whatever 
stuff 

if you do not care
about what you are doing 

then you will be miserable 
and you will make everyone else 

miserable
as well 

if someone convinced you
that what you care about 

is stupid 
then you need to find the strength 

to laugh at their absurd 
idiocy 

that is part
of the practice

don't worry 
about

what you think 
other people

will
think

instead 
finish your work 

and show them what you care about 
and then they will tell you what they think

it will be different 
than what you think they will think 

regardless of what they think 
good or bad 

my advice remains –– 
do what you care aboutTO SIMPLIFY

often 
I write illegibly in my notebook 

for 
no reason 

I try to get to the end 
of my thoughts

but there is no end
to it 

even when it seems like that is it 
there is always another 

even when it seems like the thoughts are about nothing
when it seems like they are so banal 

a thread is pulled
and there are even more thoughts 

I like to write as much as I can 
about as little as possible 

when I read a sentence that is too complicated
I find myself scratching my head

and going to the fridge
for a snack 

it is very complicated 
to simplify things

but it is good
for things to be simple 

if you can simplify something 
for yourself

or for a friend
I think it is a good way to be helpful 

it is a good thing
to consider REMEMBER TO WRITE POORLY

in this moment 
I am unsure what to write 

I have been sitting here for some time
my thoughts are unclear 

I have lost sight
of allowing myself to write poorly 

as 
a discipline 

in 
itself 

I have to remember 
to write poorly 

I have to remember
not to care 

as an antidote 
for caring 

to not allow
myself 

to try to be 
more

than
what I already am 

my thoughts are scattered 
the sun is setting behind me 

I have not written a great poem 
but I am happy to have reminded myself 

to let go 
of it HOLDING THE CAMERA AGAIN

I am thinking of going to the camera store 
tomorrow

to look at 
the cameras

it is always good
to have a camera 

that you are happy 
with 

you need to find one 
that you enjoy using 

you need to find one 
that feels right in your hands 

I am thinking back 
to when I was fifteen or so 

I was filming 
my friend 

as he did
stuff

I ran into the street
to get a wider shot

and I got hit by a truck
and fractured my hip 

since then 
I usually let someone else hold the camera 

but lately 
I have been enjoying 

holding the camera 
again 
THE BIRD THAT I SAW

I was standing at the counter
eating potato chips

and thinking
about what I was doing 

I was thinking about standing there 
eating potato chips 

I am thinking of the bird I saw in the park 
this morning 

he was plucking a worm
from the grass

standing 
with the worm in his beak 

I am happy to be the same 
as the bird that I saw 
UNKNOWN STRUCTURE

today
I sat in the dentist's chair 

they played the news 
on a screen 

while the hygienist 
scraped at my teeth 

I saw that some kids in Winnipeg got hurt
while on a field trip 

the police woman 
explained it vaguely 

she said that she did not know what structure 
that they were standing on 

***

someone lit a firework off 
on a bus 

the hygienist stopped what she was doing 
and we watched the footage 

she went back 
to scraping my teeth 

at the end of the appointment
the dentist told me that I am clenching my jaw a lot and it's messing up my gums 

it isn't because of the kids
or the fireworks 

it is just because 
of whatever I have been doing SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE

somewhere along the line 
I got it in my head that writing poems is stupid 

and that writing them made me seem like a fool 
and a loser 

but I have always loved 
writing poems

even 
despite myself 

when I was younger 
I used to study the great poets

but I never read poems anymore
now I just write them 

now I am thinking of 
sushi

since my wife has been pregnant we haven't had it much 
not like how we used to 

I suppose I've been avoiding it
in solidarity

not because of altruism 
but because of codependence 

and codependence, like poetry 
seems to be something that I also can't help

and something 
that I don't understand 

laying these things out 
here in this poem –– is good 

it is a way of 
putting the ideas down to rest 

I will begin to reconsider the idea 
that writing poems is stupid 

and that writing them 
will make me seem 

like a fool 
and 

a 
loser SOME OF THE TIME I AM OK AT IT

here I am 
sitting on the front steps with my cat

we are enjoying the breeze 
and the shade

a bird swoops past and 
he at once 

snaps upward 
and tries to nab it 

that would have been a great lunch 
instead we will stick to kibble 

we are watching the leaves in the wind 
and we are not thinking of much 

eventually we will go back inside 
and return to clicking around the computer 

it will feel like time is running out
when we are clicking around the computer 

–– it is complicated 
to be present 

some of the time 
I am ok at it 

and other times 
I am not here at all
I CAN SEE ITS FACE

last night we were driving 
and my wife pointed out the moon 

"I can see its face"
she said 

I looked up and thought 
–– oh yah that guy

for a moment 
I thought I knew the guy 

as I looked back towards the road 
I realized 

that I'm not sure I know
that guy 

in a way 
it is similar to seeing yourself in the mirror 

somehow 
despite knowing 

how well you know that guy 
you are still left unsure 

it is not a question 
that needs an answer 

but I will say 
that it is good

to pay attention 
to the moon 

not for any reason 
in particular 

it is just a good thing
to do SITTING CURIOUSLY AND STUBBORNLY

sitting curiously 
and stubbornly 

in my ego 
and without it 

I am considering what 
I can muster 

    I am considering 
what is musterable
 
–– enjoy your life 
in whatever way you can 

–– do not 
over eat 

    the library is open until eight thirty this evening 
but my hold still has not come in

I have been checking their website compulsively 
I am waiting for a book by a dead guy to arrive on the shelf 

I would like to read the book by the dead guy 
to see what I can get from it 

    earlier today 
after I got off the subway 

I threw both of my pens in the garbage
for no other reason 

than 
they were both out of ink 

    remembering this 
I have taken two other pens from my drawer 

and put them 
into my bag 

in case I need to write anything down 
tomorrow ON SALE

it is good 
to write less

like a sale 
at the store 

it is good
to save

it is good
to get more for less

already I have said too much 
already I have repeated myself 

I want to offer you a great deal in reading this poem 
but in the end you will see

the reason
it is on sale 
WAIT QUIETLY FOR THE BILL

we went to eat at a restaurant
close to our house 

it was great
they had chicken shawarma, hummus, pickles and all kinds of stuff like that 

I was happy to eat there
with my wife 

I am happy to have had the opportunity 
to eat at a restaurant today 

we are very lucky 
every time we get to sit at a table 

and look at a menu
and order something to eat 

to have the money 
to pay for it 

to have the time 
to sit and take our time and eat the food 

to sit and wait quietly 
for the bill

we brought home a lot of leftovers 
I am looking forward to enjoying them –– tomorrow 

I WILL DO THE SAME

when I was writing earlier this afternoon 
I tried to look closely 

at 
the belief 

that I see myself as a weak 
artist 

because I do not make that much money 
or have that big of an audience 

I wonder what I have against 
artists that don’t make much money 

I wonder what I have against 
artists that don’t have much of an audience 

I wonder what I have against 
myself 

there is a discipline that comes along 
with being an unsuccessful artist 

despite your constant self criticism 
you find a way to keep yourself afloat 


you sit with your doubt  
and you find a way to move forward

perhaps I see myself as a weak artist 
because I know that inevitably I cannot prevent myself from dying 

perhaps that is what 
is beneath the rock 

I don’t know if I will care much about the art I made 
when I am going to die 

instead I will care about saying goodbye to my family
and my friends 

and at the end of the day 
I will care about saying goodbye 

to 
myself 

try to imagine the conversation you will have with yourself 
when you are going to die 

try to make art 
to honour that connection 

try to make art 
to honour the times that you were there 

for 
yourself 

try to accept 
that it will all end 

and 
I will do the same FEW THINGS COMPARE

I am enjoying my life 
sitting here 

listening to music 
on my headphones 

and drinking
a can of pineapple flavoured sparkling water 

even when the can is empty 
and I don’t know what song to listen to next 

even when my chair is broken 
and my headphones are broken 

I will still find a way 
to sit 

and enjoy 
listening to some music 

regardless of what is going on 
it has always been one of the great ways to enjoy life

few things 
compare 
I STILL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HER

I have taken a shower and clipped my 
Fingernails 

Now it is time to sit and 
Write 

Lately 
I have been thinking about my wife 

I have been thinking about how things were 
And about how things are 

In a way 
Nothing has changed 

I still look forward to seeing her 
Every day 

I noticed that 
After I clipped my fingernails 

And went in
To the shower 

Before I sat down 
To writeCONSIDERING MILLIMETRES

Yesterday 
I capitalized all of the lines in my poem 

I don’t know what the point of it is 
I think it looks worse and is illogical 

But I will do it again 
Today 

I would like to spend some time sitting and breathing 
At some point 

Capitalizing these lines… 
It seems like a way to avoid that 

Refining pointless 
Details 

In my line of work 
Considering millimetres is dumb 

Details 
Are overrated

I don’t know if I will 
Continue 

Capitalizing these lines 
Instead I will consider sitting and breathing 

As a way 
To be GOD BLESS THE PUBLIC LIBRARY

I have some library books 
that are due soon 

I was anxious that my wife was going to go into labour 
before I had a chance to return them

my wife's due date 
is tomorrow 

when a library book is due 
it must be returned 

when a baby is due 
is will be taken out 

in a way 
it is like you are borrowing the baby 

from 
itself 

you have to take good care of it 
until it is time to return them 

if you rip any of the pages
or spill something on it 

you will have to pay a large fine 
and lose your membership 

I know this metaphor 
is mostly useless 

and I am drawing a random connection 
between two things that have nothing in common 

but I suppose it is helpful 
to route my anxiety 

through the public library 
for now A CUP OF COFFEE OR A SLICED APPLE

I am sitting at my desk 
and wearing my slippers 

I am happy to be 
sitting here 

in a way 
I would like to sit here forever

taking a break 
every so often 

to enjoy a cup of coffee
or a sliced apple 

taking a walk in the park 
talking to my wife 

driving her to the hospital 
to deliver a baby 

sitting with my cat
outside 

that is the extent of it 
more or less 
OUTSIDE OF TIME

I have not taken time 
to write senselessly, lately 

I am due for that 
tomorrow 

I will sit with my notebook
and write senselessly

I know that it will not bring any real satisfaction 
but it is what I have to do 

for some 
reason 

I know that I will write 
about my idea of what the future will be 

and 
what I think is important about the past 

sometimes it is difficult to write outside of time 
and other times it is simple 

for me a lot of the time 
the goal is to find a way to write outside of time 

it doesn't matter to me
whether or not it is some version of the truth or some version of bullshit 

I would like to be a strong writer
in that regard 

I THINK THAT IT IS GOOD

it is good 
I don’t know what exactly 

but I think 
that it is good 

for instance it is good to have air conditioning 
and it is good to sit outside in the outside air 

it is good to see a cloud in the sky
and it is good when the sky is covered by a lot of clouds 

it is good when it seems like nothing is happening 
and also it is good when it seems like there is a lot going on 

I think 
that it is good 

I went towards the bottle of mouthwash 
and I swished it around in my mouth 

and then I drank some coffee that I had left over 
from this morning 

and now I am drinking what is left 
from a can of raspberry sparkling water from lunch 

yesterday for lunch 
I ate two muffins 

and 
a cup of instant bone broth 

tonight with dinner 
I will have some diet coke 

I think 
that it is good 

I don’t know what exactly 
but 

I think 
that it is good 
IT ISN'T MUCH

imagining that there is nothing 
is difficult 

or to phrase it more accurately  
I should say –– 

it is difficult to imagine 
nothing 

I try to do it 
every now and again 

it is unimportant 
to understand nothing 

it is obvious 
that there is nothing 

it is easy to think 
that there is nothing 

every once in a while 
it seems like there is something 

it is more difficult to understand and 
it is more difficult to hold the thought 

especially 
when you have imagined nothing 

I do not think any of this is very profound 
or notable 

it is only what I am thinking of
it isn't much WHEN OUR NUMBER IS CALLED

I would like to write thoughtfully 
but I know that lately my thoughts have been ahead of me 

We have a baby on the way 
We are not panicking but we are anxious as we are waiting here at the deli counter 

When our number is called we will need to rely on whatever faith we are able to 
still most of it will be out of our control 

Faith can be a simple idea 
Sometimes it helps to remove any religious and spiritual connotations 

And to think of it only as a way of trying to accept 
what will inevitably happen 

We have no idea what will happen 
ever 

but we can award ourselves the courage to believe  
that it will be good 

and that we will return home 
as a new family WHAT WE ORDINARILY DO

today 
we went to triage 

because we were unsure 
if Miriam's water had broken or not 

while we were at the reception
an alarm went off

and all of the nurses ran into a room 
down the hall

I don't know if I would have what it takes to do that job 
even in that moment, watching them, I had to gather a lot of strength to keep it together

I thought of my dad 
and his brother

who both work in hospitals 
and I tried to be like them 

Miriam's water hadn't broken
but her fluids were a bit low 

they will induce her 
tomorrow 

and it seems 
she will give birth the day after that 

in the meantime 
we will do what we ordinarily do 

we will go on our usual walk 
and we will make pizza for dinnerCONTRACTIONS

I was frying a cheese blintz on the stove
when my wife's contractions began 

she paced around the living room
trying to breathe

her mother sat at the table
cutting a watermelon 

and organizing the pieces into a tupperware
and then she wrote an email on her iPad 

we only talked a little 
before realizing there was no need 

now my wife is sitting on the couch 
and we are being quiet 

it seems like labour has begun 
and we will be parents soon YOUR LABOUR

There was construction in the building and you asked if there was a parrot in the wall matching your labour pains 

Deck Wars was playing on mute behind you while they put in the epidural 

After they put the epidural in you said, “my butt is tingly already.” 

You lay in the bed and were quiet and held onto the railing for most of the night

You were kind to all of the nurses and doctors that came to help 

You were brave and you were strong
NORA

Nora Libbie Gold-Barsky
Born 1:35AM 
June 23rd, 2023

Seven pounds 
Five ounces 
My daughter THE THIRD DAY OF YOUR LIFE

Today, Nora, was the third day of your life 
you slept on my stomach and we watched hbo 

you are kind and calm 
you are sensitive and understanding  

your mother sings to you often 
she has an impossible amount of love to give you 

being with you these past three days 
has brought me a sense of fulfillment that transcends anything I’ve known before 

I feel finally 
like I am where I am meant to be OUR BABY DAUGHTER

today we walked 
with our baby daughter

the sun was a bit hot 
and we became worried

there was mud on the ground
and we became worried

I can see that she has a strong
and resilient spirit 

I can see that she might be a bit of a diva 
and that she is very understanding of people and their shortcomings 

I know that is a lot to think 
about someone who only learned how to blink earlier this afternoon 

but that is what it seems like 
to me 

I have been falling in love with this little baby 
for a few days now 

even when she cries 
I feel in love with her cry

usually when people cry 
I find it annoying 

but not her
not our baby daughter LACTATION CONSULTANT

we went to an appointment at the lactation consultant 
earlier 

we learned a lot 
and got some help 

I asked the nurse there
what people did before formula 

if they couldn't produce
enough milk 

she didn't answer 
and I found myself asking again 

she looked at me and said 
that the infant mortality rate was a lot higher 

if I was to reorganize our government 
I would reroute the entire tax budget into the hospitals 

everything else 
could be left alone 

it isn't that I have a grievance with the way things are 
it is just that I am very grateful for everything the hospitals have done for us 

and 
our baby 

I think that the more resources the hospitals have
to help anyone who needs to be there 

the 
better 

we will return to the hospital again next week
for a follow up 

and I am very grateful
for that 
BEYOND THE DIAPER

I have been watching my wife 
become a mother 

she is taking perfect care
of our daughter 

I never had any doubts 
that she would

I know that our daughter will always look up to her 
I can see it already 

and 
I feel like I will always look up to our daughter

she is heroic 
in how she seizes every moment with total presence 

when I look at her 
I feel like I am connected to something that is beyond spirituality 

beyond god 
and beyond love 

it transcends 
all of that shit 

it goes beyond
the diaper WHATEVER WAY SHE SEES FIT

she hates it when we change her diaper
she becomes inconsolable 

I don't know why 
maybe because it is cold on her butt

she screams at a higher register than usual 
like she is being terrorized 

I get the impression 
that in her mind getting her diaper changed is the worst thing that has ever happened to her in her life 

and it might very well
be

and what's worse is that it keeps happening 
over and over again 

it's true that going to bathroom 
is a strange thing 

truly 
it is a bizarre and terrifying experience 

I suppose realizing that the milk that made you so happy 
has now been processed through your body 

and has decomposed into vile excrement 
is a brutal measure of reality 

she is right 
trying to comprehend the change from one end to another is a lot to handle

she is right to scream
until all of the blood in her entire body has collected into her face 

I don't know if anyone is capable of fully reconciling the idea 
but in time I hope she will become more used to it 

in the meantime she deserves to express herself 
in whatever way she sees fit HER LAUNDRY IS IN THE DRYER NOW

as I have sat down to write
I have remembered 

that I have to go downstairs and flip
the laundry 

if it was my laundry
I would ignore it

but it's for 
my daughter

so I should go deal with it
–– one moment 

ok 
her laundry is in the dryer now

it is more difficult to change her than I would have thought 
she keeps her elbows and knees locked at impossible angles 

she is stronger 
than I would have imagined 

and it is true 
that I am intimidated by her 

I saw that the moment she was born
I could see that she is entirely delicate 

and simultaneously 
much more powerful than I pretend to be SHE IS TRYING ON ALL KINDS OF EXPRESSIONS

I am sitting here
with my daughter sleeping in her bassinet

I have often sat to write 
and have been unable to think of most anything other than myself 

and now 
I am wondering what I can write for her 

what can I write that will be helpful for her 
or that will mean something to her 

I think that all I can do for her 
is to try to write authentically 

to not try to be more 
than what I am 

that is what she has been teaching me 
sleeping in her bassinet 

or this morning when I held her and we looked out the window 
together 

I saw that she is complete 
and I hope that she doesn't feel the need to be more than that

that is how I felt 
–– somehow I felt the need to be extraordinary 

and in doing so
I lost sight of myself 

she is beginning to wake up now 
she is trying on all kinds of expressions 

stretching her arms 
and squeaking 

I want her to know that she is enough 
and always will be 
LEARN HOW TO WRITE

it seems that I have to learn how to write again 
not that I ever really knew 

I am off in a cloud somewhere 
wiping milk off our baby’s cheek 

I thought of a joke today 
while I was eating a hot dog that I had microwaved

–– I don't understand why everyone got so mad at the creator of harry potter for saying what she did 
I thought she was jk

I was happy to sit and eat that hot dog 
while thinking of that joke 

it is quiet for now 
everyone is fed and sleeping 

I suppose this time to sit 
and be with my thoughts 

is all I ever wanted 
from writing 

it doesn't always matter 
if it's ten minutes or ten hours 

I will take what I can get 
and write for myself
IT JUST ISN’T APPLE SEASON

most of the apples 
in the bag that I bought 

are soft 
and bruised 

I thought I’d picked a good bag
but apparently I hadn’t 

it just isn’t apple season 
my mom in law said

she has been more focused on oranges 
and watermelon lately 

and 
rightfully so 

I am looking at one of these apples again 
I have sliced away the bruising and 

in the background I am hearing my daughter screaming 
but it is a phantom cry 

it took a long time to calm her 
this evening 

at first it seems cute 
when she screams profusely 

and then it seems funny 
and then it becomes sad and I get angry

it seems that she needs to sense my defeat
in order to become calm 

she screamed until I did not think about writing 
or work or my haircut or anything

eventually I lay her on her back 
and balanced her on my stomach and gave her my pinky finger  

once she knew I had surrendered my full attention to her 
she became quiet and I felt the gas bubbling in her stomach as she slept 

what did you think having a daughter was going to be?
she asked me 

I lay there defeated
until my wife returned from her bath 

and 
when I went downstairs for an apple 

I remembered what my mom in law said earlier
–– it just isn’t apple seasonA DEVIL AND A MONKEY

I once went to visit you
when you moved to Los Angeles   

you wore your red fleece sweater
and we went to the grocery store to look at snacks

while we walked there you thought it was funny to pretend that you were going to cut my head 
off 

we have a baby now
she is lying on my legs while you are in the bath 

she began to cry 
so I held her and she told me that she is unsure if she wants to be a devil or a monkey 

I told her that to be a person 
you have to be both a devil and a monkey 

she stopped crying 
then 

we looked at one another 
and I saw her face in a new way 

eventually you returned from the bath 
and you took her 

you are buying a new stopper for the bath on the internet  
because ours doesn’t actually fit 

we have been in love 
for some years now 

I still feel like you are my new girlfriend 
even though you are my wife AN IMPOSSIBLE AND CHRONIC FEELING

even though I am writing
I find myself wishing that I had more time to write

it is an impossible 
and chronic feeling 

I forget how to write in a way 
that feels satisfying 

this weekend I will print the poems I wrote this week
including this one 

I will sit in my chair 
and I will read them 

I will think about the difference of what they say
and what they intended to say 

I will try to accept them for what they are 
and then I will move on to writing a new one 

maybe it isn’t about having time to write
instead it’s about having the focus 

I suppose the advice I want to give myself 
is this –– 

do what you can focus on 
everything else is bullshit FROM AFAR IT IS ONLY AN EAR

one day 
I would like to buy a special type of lens for my camera 

it is a type of lens that makes it so that you can look at things
extremely closely 

I was thinking about it 
because earlier this week 

when we were out on a walk 
my wife filmed my ear to show all of the wax in it 

you could see it ok
but I wonder what it would have been like if we had a special macro lens 

it is good to look at things as closely as possible 
it is a good way of appreciating what may seem mundane 

from afar 
it is only an ear

but looking closely 
there is a lot to find DIGESTING THE MILK

after all these years 
of being myself

I wonder if it has ever been any more complicated 
than 

milk
and gas

I can feel how my daughter’s skull has hardened 
her hair is filling out and her limbs are growing 

but the need for milk and the difficulty of digesting it 
remains 

me, you and the next guy 
we’re all just digesting the milk 

screaming 
in between 

laughing dumbly 
at things we cannot even see 

perhaps there is no need to think
that there is anything more than that 
THE APPLE TASTE

sometimes when I eat an apple 
it gets a strange texture that I love

often you can taste that texture 
in a dried apple 

and sometimes 
that taste comes in a real apple 

I know some people think a lot 
about what is going on in the world 

reading all kinds of interesting things 
and being able to write about it  

but for me 
writing is different

it is about emptying the tank 
and focusing on as little as possible 

until 
I come up with something 

I don’t know how to explain 
what it is 

it is just 
something

I often feel self conscious about the value of what I write
but I always keep going ahead 

trying to find 
the apple taste 
MY CAT

sometimes when I finally sit down to write
my cat decides to jump onto my desk 

he walks across my keyboard 
pushes his head against the monitor 

and opens the desk drawer
with his paw

he did it today 
so I walked with him downstairs to the fridge

and served him a quail 
egg 

it has meant a lot to me 
to have a cat like him 

I consider him my best friend 
in the world 

I hope that he knows how much that I care about him 
I hope that he knows how brave he is 

I am supposed to go home to visit my family sometime in the next few months
I need to bring my daughter there to meet everyone 

but the truth is I don't want to go 
because I don't want to leave my cat 

I don't want to be away from him
even for one day

he is sleeping now in his cat tree
my best buddy of all time YOU HAD TURNED THIRTY THREE YEARS OLD

today was your birthday 
when I was at work you texted me 

“She just fell asleep. That was the toughest round yet I think. 
I had to cry with her for a while because she wouldn’t stop”

when I came home Nora was downstairs with your mother 
you had your hair in a towel

you were watching tv and pumping milk 
you had turned thirty three years old 

you are pumping milk again now
Nora is sleeping in the bassinet beside you 

we tried to show you how much we love you
by spending our money and drawing you cards 
 
but we aren’t able to explain ourselves 
to the full extent 

still 
I think you know that our world revolves around you 

soon another year will pass
in what will seem like only a few days 

you are sleeping now and I am trying to calm Nora 
I hope you will be able to get some rest 
NEW MEMORY

I got to spend some good one on one time  
with my daughter today

I set her bassinet up on my desk 
she slept until she got fussy 

I changed her diaper a few times
I gave her milk and burped her 

I am very grateful to have this new memory 
spending the day together in my office 

tomorrow when I go to work downtown I will miss her 
I will look at pictures of her on my phone during my lunch break 

and I will look forward to getting home at the end of the day 
to see her again TOMORROW WE ARE GOING TO WAL MART

tomorrow we are going to wal mart 
I am having trouble remembering why 

I am happy to sit here not knowing why 
but I have remembered 

we need to get some more formula for the baby 
I don't know why we are going to wal mart and not some other store

it is just what my wife said that we are going to do 
so that is fine 

I am laughing thinking about it for some reason 
how banal it can be 

she said that since it is raining 
we will go to wal mart 

it is all quite beautiful 
the thought of the impending rain and the thought of wal mart 

it is enough to sit here now
and think of it MY FINAL WILL

I would like to write another poem 
about my cat

he is sitting by the window 
watching the night

when I walked by 
he lifted his head and turned to see me 

in that moment I felt overwhelmed by 
pure love 

I went and scratched his head and he stretched out 
and yawned 

I do not know how many poems I will need to write for him 
I do not know how many is acceptable 

but without further ado 
I will now write my final will 

it is my request to whoever deals with my casket 
that I am buried with my cat 

if I die before him
please do not bury me until he has died as well so that this can be arranged 

please respect this wish 
I don’t need a funeral or a tombstone or anything 

just do whatever is necessary to assure
that we are buried together 
MORNING WALK & LUNCH BREAK

at the store today
I bought some deli turkey 

I thought that for dinner 
I would eat a sandwich with it 

but instead
we ate leftovers

tomorrow 
I will make myself a turkey sandwich 

I will put on mustard and mayo 
and lettuce 

I feel as though this sandwich 
will be my refuge 

as lunch breaks 
often are 

in this moment 
the idea of the sandwich 

already is providing me some comfort 
in how I am feeling 

I need to start waking up early again 
and going on my morning walks 

but I've found it difficult to leave
my wife and daughter

even 
for a short time

I know that it will sort itself out 
eventually 

in the meantime 
I will talk to my wife about it 

she will probably tell me 
that it is perfectly fine 

to go on a walk 
tomorrow 

of course
it is okI WANTED TO GIVE IT A SHOT

my daughter is crying in the other room 
as my wife gets her ready for bed 

the cat is sleeping in the closet 
covering his ears 

I am trying to write something down 
here 

it seems as though she is calm now 
her diaper is changed and she has had her milk 

my hands feel stained in baby shit 
my daughter is foremost a milk gremlin

when I see her 
I kiss her on the head
 
but it is of no use to her 
it is all about milk

for my cat
it is usually about food also 

for my wife
it also is 

here is my cat now 
he also wants his food

my life now 
seems to mostly be about getting food for people 

my wife had 
her cereal 

I had my turkey sandwich 
and my apple 

so it seems everyone is good 
and we can all go to bed

for the most part I am disappointed 
by what I have written here 

I knew I had nothing to say 
but I still wanted to give it a shot 

and I suppose I can't deny 
that it is the truth of what is going on 
THRASHING OUT OF THE WOMB

lately 
I am unsure what I am writing about 

after sitting with the baby 
as she cries and farts and pukes

I come to sit 
and focus

I am not entirely depleted 
but I can see how the reserve drains 

on one hand, 
I can see how my usual neurosis is less desperate to be burned 

but on the other 
I can see how the impulse has become weak 

there is a certain softness that is always lingering on my hands 
even when I am in an elevator and she is back at home 

even after I use hand sanitizer 
twice or three times it is still there 

having a baby has made me a better person 
in that I am able to see people differently 

we do not choose to be idiots 
we are simply helpless creatures 

regardless of how much thrashing we do 
and how much wisdom we look like we have 

we are born knowing everything 
and then every day we forget a little bit more 

we are born thrashing out of the womb 
and we seldom stop 

I am thrashing now as I cry and fart and puke all over myself 
I have never changed I HOPE THAT THINGS WILL BE OKAY AND THAT I WILL DIE PEACEFULLY

I hope that things will be okay 
and that I will die peacefully 

I hope that I have enough time to work on my art
until then 

I am looking forward to watching my daughter grow up
I am looking forward to being with my wife 

I don't know where we will travel
but it will be nice to be a tourist in a new place every once in a while 

I would like to sit and drink coffee 
somewhere that the weather is nicer than it is at home 

I would like to sit 
and think about some vague idea for an art project 

I would like to never make that art project
and instead eat a modest dinner with my family 

I would like to wake up early tomorrow 
and sit with my cat for fifteen minutes or so 

before I have to leave
and take the train to workMASTERPIECES ARE STUPID

masterpieces are stupid 
I would prefer to write ephemeral bullshit

that is the job I have invented for myself 
to express myself clearly 

with what I have 
today

there is no revenue 
there are no critics 

there is nowhere to go 
there is no growth

all I can do 
is honour the fact that I am not dead 

that is today's poem 
and now it is time to move on 
KICKING A CAN THROUGH THE GRASS

I am sitting and thinking about what to write 
but there is little I am thinking about 

yesterday I found myself thinking that I wanted to write shorter poems 
so I should be pleased that I don’t have much on my mind 

still I feel the need to kick the can through the grass 
because that’s what it is 

there is no point to it 
it’s just good to kick it along 

until it gets caught somewhere 
or goes off into the road 

and then the can is gone 
and you go on still thinking mostly about nothing 
FROM NOW UNTIL ETERNITY

my daughter is crying 
and my wife is trying to calm her 

I am sitting in a rocking chair across the room 
trying not to offer redundant advice 

I care about two things 
getting to spend time making art 

and 
being decent to my family 

that is what I will focus on 
from now until eternity 

I will also enjoy eating fast food 
every now and again 

for the most part 
everything else in life hasn’t done much for me 

my wife has put our daughter back into the bassinet 
she is calm now PUSH THE ROCK UP THE HILL

my mom 
and dad

have been 
in town 

we are beginning to see how my daughter 
looks like my mom

tonight we ate fried chicken 
together 

I relate to them differently 
now that I have a daughter of my own

no one knows anything 
we are all insane 

inevitably 
we cannot avoid the judgment we feel 

everything
is okay 

push the rock up the hill 
with whatever love you can muster 

and accept 
that it will never be enough

I WILL LET GOD OR WHOEVER DECIDE

at this point 
my ambition 

is to sustain my life 
for another fifty years 

I would like to write each day 
until then 

I would like to read 
some good books 

I would like to see 
how bald I become 

and 
I would like to tell some good jokes 

I would like to know my daughter 
well 

I would like my wife 
to outlive me 

I would like to make art as often as I want 
for as long as I want 

every day 
until then 

despite whatever success 
or failure that the future has in store… 

it is what it is 
I will let god or whoever decide THE GREATEST LUXURY

I am sitting in my underpants 
picking my nose 

drinking a can of sparkling water
white noise is playing in the background 

I would like to go for a long walk in the sun
I would like to sit and read in the air conditioning 

I would like my thoughts to become calm 
I would like to become excited about some passing idea 

I would like to taste a strange olive oil
I would like to fast for three days 

tonight I will sleep
and tomorrow I will drink coffee 

I will enjoy writing something down into my notebook 
and sitting as my thoughts wander aimlessly  

on one hand I have no idea who I am 
and on the other I feel completely aware of myself 

at the end of the day it is all mostly irrelevant 
which in a way is the greatest luxury I know I WAS GOING TOWARDS AIR CONDITIONING

this morning 
I wrote a poem 

I knew that it was too desperate 
to share 

I am looking at it now 
and I can see why I wanted to scrap it 

but I will share it 
regardless –– 

it seems pathetic 
more than anything

the sadness and discomfort that overwhelms the day 
when I am unable to spend time making art 

it is not about love or fun 
or any particular goal 

it is not about privilege 
or poverty 

it is not about god
or atheism 

or myself 
or anyone 

there is no end to it 
–– 

that is what I wrote 
when I was standing on the sidewalk this morning 

I was ashamed of myself
and felt a sense of conviction 

the sun was there 
between the buildings 

I was going towards
air conditioningKNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT DEAD

I would like to drink a cup of coffee 
and sit in a plaza 

I would like to write something illegible 
in a notebook 

I would like to eat a piece of fish 
and some salad

I would like to watch something on tv 
that was good 

for now 
I will sit in this chair 

imagining 
all of that 

often the thought and wanting 
means more than experience 

you forget there are bugs in the plaza
you forget writing is often meaningless 

you forget how expensive a nice dinner can be 
you forget how ephemeral even the best tv can be 

all you can do 
is sit quietly with yourself
 
and know 
that you are not dead A GOOD LESSON

I know that this poem
will not be the best 

I can tell that I am unfocused 
and that my thoughts are springing around 

but still I am sitting here 
trying to get something down 

tomorrow I think I will eat macaroni and cheese 
for lunch 

and I will sit with my daughter 
and I will see how she has learned to smile 

a bit more 
each day

I suppose that is a good lesson 
that she is teaching 

that said 
she also has learned to projectile shit

from her change table 
to the wall

and she has a new habit of suddenly waking up from a peaceful nap
hysterically screaming

so do with that 
as you will
ELBOW MUSTARD

today at the dentist 
when the needles came out 

I tried being brave
but I began to lose sight of things 

I became faint
and then I became drenched in sweat 

as things worsened 
it seemed like I was going to pass out 

I couldn't seem to calm myself down 
I thought that it might be possible that I was going to die 

I thought of my wife
and I thought about my baby daughter 

I thought of her face
and how it feels to be with her 

I felt like the thought of my daughter 
was the only thing holding me to the ground 

and then 
I settled 

and they fixed up my tooth
and sent me on my way 

I went home
and sat with her

until we went 
to costco 

we filled our cart 
with things to eat 

and after we paid I went to the bathroom and there was a guy there with the same glasses frames as me
he was washing his hands and I saw that he had mustard on his elbow

I thought that could be me 
with mustard on my elbow

but that was his day 
and I had mine 
HER MOTHER’S ARMS

tomorrow I am flying to Vancouver
for my sister’s wedding 

I am always scared 
to go on planes 

because of how high up 
they go into the sky 

it will be the first time 
I’ll spend a night away from baby Nora

I am glad she will be safe at home 
low to the ground 

sleeping
in her mother’s arms 
HOTEL ROOM

I am thinking of my wife 
and daughter 

they are sleeping 
back home 

they have 
my heart
PLANE

I thought of writing differently 
while on the plane 

I am unsure how to explain what I mean exactly 
it is just something I felt 

I will see how much of it sticks 
tomorrow 

for now I could use an aspirin 
and a glass of water 

THINKING ABOUT WHEN I WILL SEE MY FAMILY AGAIN

I was anxious about all of the family stuff that I had to do 
these past few weeks 

my parents came to meet Nora 
and then I went to Vancouver for my sister's wedding 

now I am back 
and I won't see them again for a little while 

sometimes I don't see my family for six months 
or a year at a time 

but I am lucky 
my sister might come to visit in a few weeks

and 
I will see my mom and dad again next month

we will meet them in Montreal 
for a weekend 

I'm looking forward to the drive out there
and seeing them 

I'm looking forward to them getting to see 
how Nora will have changed 
BREAKING EVERYTHING DOWN TO NOTHING

we went to costco today 
to buy a new mattress 

we had to order it for delivery 
because it wouldn’t fit in our car 

I think it will come 
next Monday 

when we were figuring out which one to buy 
I saw a mattress online that was made out of grass 

it was very thin
only about one inch tall 

I would like to try a mattress like that 
one day 

Miriam said she wouldn’t mind me getting one 
it would be good for the nights when I can’t sleep 

I could go lay on it 
in my office 

and when the baby is transitioning to her crib 
I could sleep on the ground beside her 

as I am sitting in my chair now
I am imagining lying down on a grass mattress 

as I consider it 
my back feels better already 

we have been feeling a bit depressed lately 
and I will say that somehow this seems like the answer 

perhaps things have become too soft 
and it is time 

to break everything down 
to nothing 
SELECTED POEMS

since reading too many of my own poems 
I find that my superstition has come true 

and I am finding that when I sit down to write 
I am in my own way 

I am working on selecting the best poems that I’ve written from the past few years 
and making a book 

called
selected poems 

I don’t know why the good ones seem good
and the bad ones seem bad 

but it’s obvious 
when you read them 

sometimes months pass
without writing a good one

and other times 
I’ll write a few good ones in a row 

I always knew that I was writing a lot of bullshit 
and it’s true that I was 

but I think they’ve gotten better 
for the most part 

I would imagine this one would get scrapped
but still it deserves a chance FIFTY MORE YEARS

they repaved the road outside of our house today 
we have a new mattress 

the nightlight is on in the hallway 
there are shadows on the ceiling 

I am on the surface level 
I am drinking a lime soda water

tomorrow we are planning to go to the corner grocery store 
to see if they have anything on sale 

my hope is that I don’t die 
for at least fifty more years SIT QUIETLY AND WRITE

I wonder if I will stop writing poems 
at a certain point 

I could exercise more 
I could read the news every once in a while 

I could relax and watch tv 
but instead

I am sitting here 
trying to put something together 

there isn’t much of a reason to do it
that I can come up with 

it is just what I need to do 
for nothingOUR BUS

earlier my mom sent me a photo of the reservoir near the house we lived in when I was growing up 
It is impossible to explain how that place makes me feel.  it brings me back to who I am. It is a man made body of water so there is only so much awe it can inspire 

now I am sitting on a bus 

I am anxious to get home for no reason other than to have a cold drink and see my family 

The pattern on the bus floor is speckled yellow, blue and pink

It is more interesting than you might imagine 

It is more pleasing to look at than the darkness and headlight streaks on the other side of the window 

The woman in front of me is reading a brochure of the different art classes to take in the city 

Our bus is stuck between a construction site and another bus. The other bus is somehow parked an inch away from ours. I was too busy reading over this woman’s shoulder to see how we got here. 

We have been here for fifteen minutes now, waiting for the other bus to move. Our driver could probably make it out but he doesn’t want to risk it. The situation is idiotic 

but ultimately I am quite satisfied with my life and the way things have turned out 
IF I AM STILL FEELING DEPRESSED

We took all of the apples from the fridge and cut them up and blended them and squeezed out the fibre and made juice

There was no need to add any sugar or water or anything

It reminded me of every apple I've ever ate in my life but it also tasted new 



I was feeling depressed this afternoon I think that if I understood why the feeling would vanish 

It isn't about anything in specific it is a mix of things 

I think exercise will help 



Tomorrow I will set my alarm clock early and go for a walk like I used to I will see what kind of light there is 

If I cannot find what I need there then I will drink more apple juice 

Either way I will come home and drink apple juice 



If I am still feeling depressed I will consider the apples and their imperfections 

I will think of how we cut them and blended them and squeezed out the fibre and made the juice 

And still, if I am feeling depressed –– I will ignore the feeling and move on A POCKET OF CALM

Tomorrow we are going to go to one of my favourite coffee shops to buy some beans and afterwards we are going to go for a walk in High Park 



If you don't pay attention it is easy to see the trees like stores in a shopping mall, instead I will try to find a pocket of calm 



I am trying to find a way to articulate how I am feeling –– disconnected, bored and lost...
it sounds worse than it is 



I am trying to find an angle to share some gratuity or something that I am excited about but it all feels a little faint 



I feel like if I was able to better explain it then I would be able to move past it but I'm unsure what it is



I will call it a day for now and tomorrow I will try to move slowly and focus on seeing the trees for what they are 
THE HILL

This morning when I was walking up the hill I began to feel like my old self 
it has been difficult to keep up with my exercise since the baby was born 

but I shouldn’t have lost track of it 
I can see the toll it has been taking on my mood 

When I came home after my morning walk I went down to give my cat a scratch on the head 
I felt my back seize and I have barely been able to walk all day 

If I had been taking better care of myself then I probably wouldn’t have messed up my back 
so when I am better I will get things back under control 

For me it is best to have a routine for everything 
I will start again, walking up the hill LEVELLING

For the most part I spent the day lying in bed watching videos online and writing in my journal 
It seems like this crippling back pain has dealt with the depression I was feeling the past few days 

It is possible that this is my body’s way of levelling me 
First it had tried to get me to relax with the bad mood but when that didn’t work is just cranked my back out and put me out of commission 

I’m noticing that it’s getting darker earlier now 
I’ll look forward to the fall and the winter 

I’ll get back into shape 
I will push our daughter’s stroller through the leaves and the snow 
HOW TO BECOME STRONG

When I was crossing the street today the cars had to wait as I limped across 
This injury has helped slow me down 
It has helped me away from panicking and wanting what I don't have 

I noticed some tomatoes in someone's garden 
I thought that they looked strong even though they were discoloured and mushy and they could not stand on their own and they were tied to a stick 
I looked at the tomatoes and thought, that is how to become strongTHE TUNING FORK

I am happy to sit here
on the couch

I am looking at the pot lights in the ceiling and noticing how they sprout outward into a meaningless constellation
I suppose they look like a tuning fork

I don’t know if I feel like I am looking forward to the rest of my life 
but I do have the sense that I am looking forward to tomorrow 

it seems that I am feeling a bit better 
than I have been 

I don’t really know what set me off last week 
and I don’t really know what got me out of it 

maybe there is no reason but I will say that the walk I took yesterday was good 
that will be something I will keep doing for the rest of my life 

I will look forward to seeing trees and clouds 
and sunlight 

eventually I will die and I will not see any of those things 
againSPENDING THE DAY WITH MY SISTER

Sometimes I feel like I know who I am or that I have an idea of myself
and usually that feeling is misguided 

Other days I feel desperate to know and that I am distant from myself 
and usually that feeling is also misguided 

There are other days I do not feel the need to know and I do not care to know 
today was like that 

My sister was in town
we ate at restaurants and walked along to all of the stores

I am happy that she flew out to be with us
and that she got to meet baby Nora

Often around her 
I feel like myself 
THE SHORE

the light is on in the bathroom
from where I am sitting I can see the bathmat on the ground and a bit of the soap on the countertop 

I bought a new bottle of extra strength ibuprofen gel caps from Costco today 
in a way I looked forward to taking some of them but that would require some discomfort 

my daughter and I have been working on a new secret handshake 
I will not write what it is here 

I have written three things for my enjoyment 
there is a part of me that wants to delete them 

I am thinking about the part of me that wants to delete them 
I am not sure if that part of me is driving the ship or watching us fade off into the horizon 

but there they are 
I can't tell whether or not they are waving or holding up their middle finger 

there
they are getting smaller as we get further away from the shore 
I DO NOT WANT TO LOSE SIGHT OF EASE

I have always found it difficult to write 
I don't think that I'm very good at it 

I don't say that to be self depreciating 
but I think that it is an impossible thing to be good at 

it is a difficult thing to measure 
by anyone's standard 

it seems like being a dad is similar 
it is difficult 

it isn't easy to be a part of a family 
and it isn't easy to be alone 

tomorrow I will wake up 
and begin again 

I think that there is a way to know that things will be difficult 
and they should be treated with ease 

I do not want to lose sight 
of ease 
SLOW MOVING

when I was walking to the subway today I saw a guy wearing a blue shirt 
he was standing near a door, opening it with a key 

I don’t know why it stood out to me 
it might have been the way the color of the blue on his shirt looked near the color of the sign behind him 

the sign was also blue, but a different kind of blue 
I think it was teal 

he walked through the door and went nowhere 
never to be seen again 

afterward I used the hand sanitizer from the automatic dispenser 
and then I waved the thing that made the door open for me 
THE HYPOTHETICAL WHEEL

earlier today, when I was writing in my journal 
I had the feeling that it was pointless

that pointlessness used to inspire me 
but now it feels different 

it feels like I can't focus properly 
or at least I can't focus on it enough to make the process worth the while –– to make it meaningful 

I feel like I want to say that the wheel is moving too quickly 
and it is impossible to catch up to 

I don't know what type of wheel it is 
it's just a hypothetical wheel 

it's wooden and old and the sun blares downward onto it
the grass is dead beneath it

people come to look at it 
they don't know why they are interested in it but they are 

a lot of people take pictures of the wheel 
some even take videos of it on their phones 

it is isn't very often that they look back at the photos or the videos 
or send them to anyone 

but for some reason they all just had the urge to capture it 
when they were there 
ENDING

I wanted to write something 
about writing the ending of a poem 

I will say that I've realized there isn't a need to resolve or to say anything 
like I thought there was

it is good to end on a confused note
or a curious note or anything 

the point often is to take the time to say something that cannot be said 
ordinarily 

what else would be the point of writing in this form
if not to allow idiocy and incoherence 

there is no story or point or anything 
and at any moment, for no apparent reason at all, you can just end BEING THERE

I have to brush my teeth 
soon 

and then I have to close my eyes 
and go to sleep 

and then I have to have 
a dream 

and then 
I will wake up 

and I will give my cat some breakfast
and I will make my coffee

the day will be new 
and I will try to be there 

some days I am there 
and other days I am not 

some days I am able to get there
and other days I am unable 

I cannot expect that every day 
I will be there 
STATE OF THE UNION

I have been having a hard time focusing 
and taking care of myself 

I don't know what it is 
perhaps I have been drinking too much coffee

this might be how a lot of people feel 
as new parents 

I have only been a dad 
for two months 

it seems difficult 
to get my feet into the ground WITH OUR PICTURES

I was looking at a book I got from the library
it is about a painter

most all of the paintings he made seemed simple enough
he showed things the way he wanted to

his paintings have a way of tricking you into seeming realistic
but if you stay with them you realize they aren’t at all

they are of things like
gas stations, bridges and people in rooms

what I like most about his pictures is that they don’t panic when you aren’t paying attention to them
they aren’t desperate like we are with our picturesTHE WORST ARTIST IN CANADA

I am sitting at the table eating slices of cheese 
I am anxious as usual 

less anxious than I was this morning 
but still anxious 

when I use the word anxious
what I mean is thinking about the future and obsessing about how things are going to go wrong 

it is a compulsive thing 
it is like my brain gets addicted to it 

worst case scenario I lose my job 
worst case scenario I am the worst artist in Canada 

I am laughing while I think of myself as unemployed 
and the worst artist in Canada 

it isn’t so bad 
imagining myself as I’ve been many times before — 

unemployed and
the worst artist in Canada 
MORNING PARKING LOT OUTSIDE THE PHYSIOTHERAPIST'S OFFICE

this morning 
I was a bit early for my physiotherapist appointment 

I went to the other end of the strip mall 
and got a coffee at tim hortons 

and I drank it 
in my car 

after a few minutes I drove back to the other end of the parking lot
and parked in front of the physiotherapist's office 

I sat and drank more of my coffee
and enjoyed being in the parking lot in the morning SATURDAYS

it is difficult to enjoy
Saturdays

I try to relax 
but I just get anxious 

tomorrow 
is Saturday 

I will try not to watch too many videos on my phone
I will try to walk as much as possible 

I will try not to drink too much coffee
I will try to cook 

I will try to have fun doing something that isn't making something or writing something down 
I will try to take a nap or sit quietly and read a book 

I will talk to you again on Sunday 
and I will let you know how it goes
IT IS ALL ECONOMICS

I resent having to deal with getting 
haircuts 

sometimes I cut all my hair off
and other times I never cut my hair 

imagine all the time you have lost
to your hair 

imagine all the time you have lost 
facing indecision 

imagine all the time that is in the forest 
where there is no wind 

and meanwhile you are sitting around 
worrying about your haircut

it happens to all of us 
every now and again 

perhaps I should have a buzz cut again 
perhaps then... things would be resolved

and perhaps I should begin eating cat food 
and sleeping on the ground 

it is all economics 
at the end of the day 
TODAY

I have been doing a bit better at chess lately 
for a while I was getting my ass kicked left right and centre 

otherwise I feel like I didn't have the most successful day 
even though I was working since early in the morning, I feel like I haven't gotten anything done 

it is like I am getting my ass kicked 
left right and centre 

I am attached to the result 
and the process 

I find it difficult to envision my success in the future 
I feel like I am where I have and always will be EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW

I spent some good time with Nora today 
a lot of it is just us looking at one another 

I feel like she is very understanding
she proves that two months on earth is all you need 

to know everything 
that there is to know 

I think that it's true that we know everything when we're born 
and then 

each day 
we forget and forget 

until 
we become totally lost 

when I was holding her today I realized that she will look to me 
when she is lost 

I will hope to do my best to guide her 
and 

I will try to find a way to teach her that she already knows everything 
there is to know THE GROCERY STORE

tomorrow I will meet my friend
at the movie theatre 

I feel a bit bad about spending the money 
I know that I will be making less in the next few months 

still we will have enough to get by 
but it can be difficult not to worry 

it is a lot of vague 
what if'ing 

none of it is rooted in any logic
it is just flailing aimlessly 

I hope that there are still apples and steaks at the store 
I hope that the electrical outlets in our house keep powering our stuff 

even if I have to get another job 
it will be okay 

I suppose no matter how bad things get 
I just hope that there is always food in the grocery store

everything else 
can probably be sorted out as it comes A NEW WAY TO MAKE MONEY

I have realized that
I’m making too much money 

doing something
that I don’t truly believe in 

I feel fraudulent 
and that I am selling out

I want to teach my daughter to trust herself 
to trust her intuition 

to not go down the path that she knows is fraudulent 
to not go down the path that she knows she is selling herself out for 

I cannot teach her that 
unless I lead the way 

so I will take the risk 
and I will follow my intuition 

I will go 
in a new direction 

and I will find a new way 
to make money DAUGHTER

after dinner tonight 
we are thinking of going to the ice cream place near our house 

they have a special cucumber ice cream 
that we are hoping to try 

there is always a long lineup there
it is well deserved 

it costs six dollars for one ice cream 
so we share it between the two of us 

one day our baby daughter will be able to try the ice cream there 
I’m looking forward to seeing her enjoy a treat like that 

she has begun crying now
having woken up from her nap HOW TO BE A GREAT ARTIST

trying to make money off of art is absurd 
it will lead you nowhere 

make art that you have no way of explaining 
make art that makes you feel embarrassed

do your best not to ask anyone what they think of your art 
their opinions are not helpful 

go to the library and find a book made by an artist that you like
think of how little that book cares what you think 

finish what you're working on as fast as possible 
don't look back at what you've made 

never have any ideas in advance 
if you do, then there is no point of acting on them

accept that you are the worst artist 
in the history of the world 

and then 
see what happensOUR WALK

today we went for a walk just the two of us  
I pushed you in your stroller while you looked up at the clouds 

I took a picture of the clouds you looked at 
I don't know if you will remember them otherwise 

you wore a pink cardigan that our friend knit for you 
and it matched the blanket that your yaya knit for you 

we walked through the park and up the hill 
and past the little library and back home TRYING TO CAPTURE THE SUN

eventually it becomes time 
to let go of the things that are not serving you 

today when I was walking with my baby daughter  
I saw that the sun was a certain way 

I tried to capture it with my camera 
but I couldn't get it the way I wanted 

when you notice something like that 
it is best to let it go 

when you have an idea for something 
it is best to let it go 

know that when a mosquito lands on your neck 
you will slap it without thinking 

that is what happened to me this evening 
when I was fiddling with my camera 

trying to capture the sun 
on our walk I KNEW IT WOULDN'T

tomorrow 
I will look forward to spending some time 

sitting and 
writing 

first thing 
in the morning 

there is something about writing 
first thing 

that beats 
any other time of day 

especially 
when everyone else is sleeping 

I don't think writing will get me anywhere 
I think that I always knew that

I tried to convince myself 
to believe that it would 

but I knew 
it wouldn't 

still
I kept doing it 

for some other reason
that I don't fully understand 

no one is really that good at writing 
even the people who are best at it 

today when I was waiting for the subway to arrive I was thinking about all of the dread and discomfort and insecurity I've pointlessly endured 
when I was walking later on I noticed that a plane was flying strangely low to the ground 

for some reason they both stuck in my mind and I wanted to note them down later 
I have done that now 

you can see how pointless the impulse to write things down can be 
but it is there 

you can try to redirect it 
or fight it or understand it 

but there is no point 
just let it be what it is and try not to think about it too much WE WERE WALKING WITH MOM

tonight 
Nora and I 

went to the library 
to return some books 

I noticed how the light crossed over her 
when we passed underneath the streetlights

in the day time the clouds passed over 
similarly 
 
at some points the sun would pass through the trees
similarly 

we were walking with mom 
in the day time 

we went to the dollar store
and the library 

I can't imagine a better 
day LUNCH BREAK

today I ate my sandwich 
on the bench I usually sit at

there was bird shit on 
it 

I put on my hat 
because the sun was burning my head 

I looked at some pictures of 
my daughter 

I missed her 
and looked forward to being home with her 

it seems like love is a thing that doesn't run out
instead it has a way of growing

I don't mean to be sentimental 
it is just how it seems to be 
FIND A WAY TO BE PRESENT

last night I had a dream that I was driving a car 
when I woke up my cat was sleeping at my feet 

tonight we ate mcdonalds 
it is good to eat there every once in a while 

it is good to lower your expectation 
as much as possible 

instead 
find a way to be present 

whether you have mistaken your cat for a gas pedal 
in a dream 

or you are eating french fries 
and diet coke 

with 
your family BULLET POINTS

sometimes 
I think of simply reiterating 

what happened 
or what I think is going to happen 

what ought to happen 
what is bound to happen 

instead 
it is better to talk about something else 

something that you don't know 
about 

some random thing 
that doesn't even make that much sense 

something 
to pick the scab on your head about

maybe by talking it over 
it will make sense 

maybe by sitting with the thing 
dismantling it and trying to build it back up 

there is some information there 
that is more useful

than thinking about what happened 
in bullet points 
ON BEING A DAD

I am sitting here 
waiting for the water to cool 

before I add in the formula 
milk mix 

six scoops 
to twelve ounces 

usually Miriam does 
everything 

but more and more 
I am helping 

I don’t want to be the best dad in the world 
but I want to be a good dad to our Nora

I really don’t know much about being a dad 
it’s only been three months 

I will go mix the milk now 
and bring it upstairs 
MY CAT

we are going to drive to Montreal 
tomorrow 

all day 
I have been thinking about my cat 

and how we won't be able to see him 
for three nights 

I know he will be taken care of 
but I worry about him 

I will look forward to coming home on Sunday 
to see him HOTEL ROOM

I didn’t realize how simple it is to get to Montreal 
from our house 

it is a straight shot along the highway 
for five hours 

we are in the hotel room 
lying in a bed that is bigger than the one we have at home 

I am thinking of our cat and wishing I was closer to him 
I wish there was a way for him to know that 

Nora is very congested 
we are trying to help her clear her nose with steam from the shower 

still 
she seems in good spirits 

I hope she will sleep well through the night 
and feel better in the morning THINKING OF MY CAT AT HOME

I am lying in the hotel bed
thinking of my cat at home 

for some reason I am thinking of his claws 
and how sometimes they dig into my arm when I am carrying him around 

I don’t know what it is that makes me miss him
it is beyond logic and reason 

it is more important than
those things 

it is impossible 
to explain ON THE STREET IN MONTREAL

I haven't been doing the best writing lately 
I have been on vacation 

staying in an expensive hotel 
eating and gawking at storefronts 

spending quality time with family 
watching reality tv 

I'm happy that my parents got to spend some good time with my daughter 
I am happy we got to sit outside and eat smoked meat sandwiches together 

I am imagining myself 
thirty years from now

I don't think I will forget that memory 
of us eating smoked meat sandwiches together 

on the street 
in montreal IT IS GOOD TO BE A HOBBYIST

I haven't been doing the best writing
lately 

which feels
disgraceful, somewhat 

I read a poem that I liked today 
in synagogue 

in the margin 
of the siddur 

it is by Merle Feld
it is called Though I Stared Earnestly at my Fingernail 

I thought in a way 
it was like a poem I would write 

it must be a strange feeling
to be published in a siddur 

I would imagine that would be a greater honour 
than I would want 

instead 
my ambition will remain in the ether 

tethered to some procrastination 
and neurosis 

I hope it does not sound self loathing 
or self pitying to say –– 

it is good 
to be a hobbyist 
BE IN THE DIRT

one thing about making art 
is that you have to go through times 

when you feel like a failure 
sometimes it lasts for an afternoon 

other times 
longer 

it seems like that is just part 
of digging towards whatever it is we are digging towards 

the only thing to do 
is to work through it 

until 
you find yourself at some reasonable conclusion 

I think that we make art 
to go through the dirt 

to see what there is 
past where we went before 

sometimes it makes us feel connected to some kind of meaning 
and other times it makes us feel disconnected from everything 

know 
that there is no avoiding it 

know
that no matter what tools you find 

or praise you get 
you will still be in the dirt THE ERA OF THE VIDEO CAMERA

I sometimes wonder 
about all of the writers 

who weren't around 
in the era of the video camera

I wonder how many of them 
would make the choice to make movies 

instead of writing 
books or poems 

it is hard to make sense 
of the difference 

usually I think that writers 
are better artists than filmmakers 

and that filmmakers are better artists 
than musicians

I have been sitting here thinking about it 
I spend a lot of time doing all three of those things 

and really 
what I think I'm saying 

is that making music is the most enjoyable, 
making movies is the second most enjoyable

and writing
is the least enjoyable

therefor 
writing sits on the top shelf 

it is nonsense 
but I just wanted to sort it out for my own sake 

my own sake 
of becoming a great artist 

that has always been my dream 
I suppose I will leave it at that HOW TO BE SINCERE

when I first started writing these poems 
I would write about squids and dirt and people that didn't exist 

I craved freedom from sense 
and intelligence 

I don't seem to have the need to write that way anymore
I tried all kinds of things these past few years of writing one poem per day 

it seems like sincerity has more mileage 
than anything else 

I don't know if posing the question -- how to be sincere -- is useful 
it isn't difficult 

it is a good way to sign a letter 
but we don't write letters like that very often at all, if ever

so I hope during this time 
of writing these poems 

if nothing else
I have learned to be 

sincere 
enough 
REFLECTING ON THE DAY

I enjoyed listening to the radio while on the subway today 
I enjoyed talking to my mom on the phone 

I enjoyed feeding a bottle of milk to my daughter 
I enjoyed a shabbat dinner with family 

sometimes it takes effort to notice what is good
and other times it is easy 

I am noticing that for some reason 
today, it was easy 

I don’t know if there is any rhyme or reason to it 
it just happened to be that way 

some days work out 
and others are a little tougher to get through 

but it is good to have a good one
when you can I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE THERE

I enjoyed walking through the woods 
today 

looking at the way the leaves were
looking at the way the sun was 

I was alone 
for the most part 

some woman asked me 
if I was looking at a bird

I told her I was just looking 
at the leaves

she seemed disinterested 
and walked away with her dog 

eventually I bumped into her again 
the dog barked at me and then licked my hand 

she told him to get down 
but he didn't listen to her 

somehow 
seeing her 

cheapened 
things 

until 
I was alone again 

a better writer would know why 
but I'm not really sure 

I walked farther away from the path after that 
where there were a lot of little bugs 

I didn't see anyone 
thereIT IS DIFFICULT TO DO

I'm often unsure 
as to what it means to take care of other people 

it may be from a lack of empathy on my behalf 
it may be because I am narcissistic 
 
it may be 
from a lack of knowing what to do 

it is difficult
and maybe that's why it is more important than anything

I haven't been a dad
for very long 

I am trying to learn 
how to take care of my family

I am trying to learn 
how to take care of myself 

there is no clear answer 
but 

I think it's probably best to start with food 
make sure the meals are under control 

and 
try to be reasonable about sleep 

let people tell you the truth 
and tell the truth 

focus
and don't ignore your intuition 

all of that said
I will admit 

I have a headache 
and I'm exhausted

I know I should stop and go downstairs and get to bed
but it is difficult to do 
VECTORS

I am unsure how to explain how I am feeling in this moment 
it is a mix of anxiousness 

and 
insecurity 

I don't think it is towards anything 
in specific 

it is just
a baseline feeling 

it seems that in a way 
I have lost sight of my vectors 

that my ability to ground myself 
has been eaten by the internet 

I think this is why I am looking forward to returning to synagogue 
on the weekend 

it does not seem corrupt 
thereMY HIGHEST AMBITIONS

tomorrow 
I would like to go somewhere 

with my camera
and film some stuff 

when I was driving today 
I saw an area that I wanted to go to 

there is a big construction site
and car washes 

and old buildings 
I thought that I would enjoy going around there 

if I can't go tomorrow
maybe I will have the chance to go 

on Friday 
afternoon 

I also need to clean up the house 
I am trying to get better at that 

I know it might not seem like much 
but at the moment 

these are my highest 
ambitions 

I want to do them carefully 
and meaningfully 

because lately 
I have been a bit more absent 

than 
I would like

to 
admit 
UNREMARKABLE FOR THE MOST PART

today 
I had the chance to go and film 

where I said 
I was going to 

it was unremarkable for the most part 
I saw birds on cranes, worn out signs, things like that 

I parked at the grocery store
and I'm glad I didn't get a ticket

I didn't think I would
even though all the signs said that I would 

I would like to go back to that area again 
maybe next time a bit more west 

I was trying to remember 
what this city was like

when I first moved here 
all of those years ago 

I can remember it was overwhelming at times 
but now a lot of it feels meaningless 

but maybe 
if I take the footage I shot and set it up just right 

I can fabricate some meaning
that will suffice GLASS OF WATER

I am sitting 
and drinking water

and looking at the light on the wall 
and some shadow from my chair 

I have been trying to keep focus 
of a good future

it is easy to become distracted 
by the lure of failure 

and the comfort 
of staying where we are 

I am sitting 
and drinking water 

the light and the shadow have gone 
a cloud has covered them 

I am sitting with my thoughts 
drinking my water

and now
I will go refill my glass in the sink 

I would offer you a glass 
as well 

I can get it for you 
while I'm up 
IT IS A BIT LIKE THE EARTH IS TAKING A NAP

we had a nap 
this afternoon 

after our walk 
in the leaves

it was as cold as its been 
since you've been born 

I had a dream 
that I heard you speak 

in some years 
from now 

you were probably four 
or six years old 

I don't know what you said 
but I could hear you were confident 

it will get a bit colder each day 
for the next while 

but you will see 
that it brings a certain peace to the air 

it is a bit like the earth is taking a nap 
we can imagine 

it is having a dream 
about somethingDEFEAT

there is something about making art
the process defeats you 

what I am working on now 
seems like an utter failure 

it looks like there is no way 
to make it work 

but still, somehow it is impossible to overcome the compulsion 
to continue picking the scab 

to continue 
exhausting the dirt 

and eventually 
through volition 

or something like that 
it will sort itself out THE THING

it seems
like

I have sorted out the thing 
I was working on 

for most of the day 
I thought it was unsalvageable trash 

but I was able to keep with it 
and now somehow 

I am beginning to have the feeling 
that it is good 

and in a way 
it is better than the other things I have made

I am always happy to have that feeling 
I suppose that is as good of a goal as any 

I still have a bit of work to do on it 
but I think I will be able to stick the landing 

perhaps the message
is clear 

do what you can 
to defeat yourself 

and then 
be relentless 

until 
you finish the thing 
ODE TO MY CAMERA

I am looking forward 
to going around 

with my camera
tomorrow 

all of this messing around with cameras 
these past few months... 

I've really enjoyed it 
a lot 

I would recommend getting a camera 
that you are happy with 

to take around 
with you 

you will notice 
the reflection in a doorknob

you will notice 
a strange passing cloud 

you will notice
that there are a lot of different ways

of looking 
at the world SYNAGOGUE

I have been sitting here 
for a while 

almost an hour 
not writing anything 

I am thinking 
about being in synagogue last weekend 

it meant something to have my daughter there 
drinking her bottle, sleeping 
FROM THE WAL MART TO THE GROCERY STORE

when we were walking from the wal mart 
to the grocery store 

I wondered who could tell
that we were jews 

I imagined how little all of this meant to some
how oblivious some of them probably were

I found myself looking at the skin of the man who worked the till 
trying to guess his nationality 

and his faith 
he was kind and went about bagging our cauliflower thoughtfully 

on the way back to the car I noticed a Canadian flag outside the wal mart 
I wasn't sure what to make of it ––

I saw the direction of the wind 
the direction of the fear that has been blown across the world 

I don't know if I am meant to pretend I am brave 
instead, I will focus on perseverance 

and trying to imagine 
reconciliation 

despite how impossible 
it seemsSOUP NEWS

I am going to make some soup tomorrow 
from lentils and cauliflower 

and chicken stock 
and onion 

otherwise
I am unsure how I feel 

I have been keeping a close eye 
on the news 

it is not as simple
as lentils and cauliflower 

and chicken stock
and onion

when we were in synagogue last 
the rabbi asked what good praying does 

he said that it isn't always clear 
he said it cannot fix a bridge but maybe it can mend our spirit

I am unsure what praying means 
in my life 

in a way 
it seems 

like making soup and reading the news 
is about as close as I get I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A CAMERA ONE DAY

we went for a walk this afternoon 
walking along where we usually do 

I took blurry pictures of plants 
while you slept 

they were just there on people's lawns 
waiting under the sun 

they are plants I have walked by 
many times 

but somehow, at the right angle, they become more than weeds and grass 
they become more than something someone bought at home depot

I am happy we have this time together 
to walk and aimlessly take pictures 

I would like to give you a camera 
one day 

you can have mine
if you would like FAITH

my default state 
often 

is that things will end in failure 
and disappointment 

it has taken me my entire life 
to understand 

that it takes a work 
to imagine a better future 

for myself
and for others 

when you cannot imagine a favourable outcome 
you have to think harder 

it's a discipline 
more than anything

I am beginning to understand that maybe that is what faith is 
maybe it doesn't need to be any more complicated than that DOUBT

I spent most of the day 
reading the news 

thinking about 
everything that has been going on 

it is impossible to know
how it will resolve

I will continue to try to imagine 
a better life for all 

while I do this 
I can sense my doubt 

as I consider that doubt 
I can see that it is my weakness 

it is unambitious 
it is moldA WAY TO ORDER THE WORLD

it was good to walk 
outside today 

I went out 
to go take pictures 

I have begun to notice
that there is a momentum to it 

if you are too precious 
and busy yourself with trying to find something good 

you won't shoot
anything

but if you just film something 
any stupid thing –– 

you will begin 
and you will film something else 

and then you are walking 
and shooting 

there are few things that I find as fun
as that

it was a good break
from studying the news 

it was a way to order the world 
in my own way 
EVERYONE TRYING TO FIND THEIR WAY

we were at costco today 
there were all kinds of people there 

many different races 
people from all over the world

everyone was looking to fill their carts
they were looking for a good price or to try something new 

usually I am trying to force my cart through 
all of the obscene traffic

but today 
I was happy to be there, among people 

everyone 
trying to find their way TRYING TO SORT OUT SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE BULLSHIT

I will look forward
to waking up tomorrow 

to drinking my coffee
and looking out the window 

the anxiety will take its hold 
as usual

I will go onto my computer 
and begin editing the video that I took last week 

I will have no idea what I'm doing
I will click the mouse and push buttons on the keyboard

I will stare at the screen 
and try to form something that aligns with my intuition 

eventually, after a few days –– I will find some way of ordering it all 
and I will ride the high of that 

and then, as usual –– I will crash and burn 
and sleep 

and then I will wake up 
and have my coffee 

and continue writing 
and editing 

and trying to sort out something 
that doesn't feel like bullshitNO RESOLUTION

I have no capacity to understand the reality of the danger that people are in 
on the other side of the world 

it won't be over tomorrow 
or in a week from now 

it seems that there is no foreseeable end to it 
it could go on for years to come 

I have been sitting here for an hour 
writing sentences 

and then 
deleting them I LOVE ART MORE THAN YOU LOVE DEATH

I have been trying to write a poem all day 
writing about how useless it feels to make art 

the truth is that I often get to thinking 
that for the most part –– art is bullshit 

but the more I sat
and the more I wrote

the more I realized that the idea was riddled in fallacy 
I realized 

that I love art 
more than you love death PERMANENCE

soon I will have written one thousand 
of these posts

my plan is to stop 
there

I am grateful to have found a way 
to write all of this 

it has taught me to know myself 
a bit better 

I wish that I could know myself 
permanently 

but I don't know if that's possible 
I wish that I could write permanently 

but I don't know if that's possible 
either PARENTING 101

I had some time today 
to go for a walk 

Nora slept 
and I took pictures of the leaves 

they are more orange now 
less red for the most part 

we had to get home to make dinner 
but I felt like we could have walked for a long time 

if it is not raining 
we will go for a long walk tomorrow

even though 
we have been up and down every street 

so many 
times

we will keep looking 
and find more pictures to take 
THE CANADIAN

I spent hours walking today 
listening to people talk about Israel and Gaza 

at some point I felt a drop of rain on my head
and I felt a surge of panic 

a rain drop 
a single rain drop 
NATURAL CAUSES

our laundry machine is broken
I washed Nora's clothes in the bathtub with some soap 

she is sleeping now 
there is white noise coming from the baby monitor 

our cat is drinking water from his bowl 
he is looking upward 

there are leftovers in the fridge 
we will watch tv before bed 

we will be lucky to one day die 
from more or less –– natural causes IN A WAY, AWAY FROM THE WORLD

I wonder what it would be like 
to move to Vancouver Island 

to grow some vegetables 
to own a firearm or two 

to be surrounded by the ocean 
to be –– in a way, away from the world 

it is unrealistic 
but 

it is nice to think about 
what it would be like IDIOCY AND TRANSCENDENT JOY

I used to write such simple and idiotic things 
here

it seems like that is no longer an option 
it seems like I am trying to get to something else

I was reading my daughter her book tonight
before bed...

it was about a hippo 
who was lonely 

he hosts a massive party 
but

in the end 
he was still lonely 

it reminded me of the kind of thing I used to write 
here

there was something about the story 
that had some kind of transcendent joy 

that could only be reached
with idiocy 

I will try to remember that 
–– CUTTING A POTATO IN HALF

today
as I was walking up the stairs 

I thought of writing about cutting a potato 
in half 

I spent most of the day reading about the Abraham accords 
and cynism 

but there was something about cutting that potato in half 
that occurred to me 

as 
something to write about 

it's true that the potatoes turned out well 
but –– 

well... 
maybe we are not as complicated as we would like to think that we areTO RETURN HOME

I walked for a long time today 
looking at buildings and trees 

listening to the news in my headphones 
there are a lot of ways the world could end 

I stopped and sat and drank a cup of coffee 
I wrote messages to my wife 

she sent me a photo 
of her and our daughter 

I drank my coffee quickly 
to return home 
THE MEANING OF LIFE

I have finished my glass of diet coke 
and am sitting beside the fireplace

the fire isn't on 
I know that I have nothing to say 

I have been enjoying listening to music 
this afternoon 

somehow 
these past years 

it seems like listening to music 
became something to augment a dull experience

always take time to listen to music that you love 
I could make the argument that that is the meaning of life

not the empty glass of diet coke
or the fireplace that isn't even on COLLECT SCRAPS OF HOPE

as I listen to the news
I try to collect what scraps of hope I can find ––

I found some solace reading the Abraham accords
they describe what peace could look like

I found myself learning about cynicism
in order to recognize it in myself, to overcome it

I am trying to collect these scraps of hope
for my daughter

to lay some kind of foundation 
that is strong enough to support the optimism I see in her

to find an angle
to show her

that we do not need to move towards
an empty future
NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINTH POEM

something I can promise 
to anyone 

is
that

writing 
is difficult 

when you sit to write 
and you feel that your gut has been vacuumed into a black hole 

think back and remember
that difficulty 

has always been your loyal 
ally 

know 
the virtue

of pushing the boulder 
up the hill 

notice how trite the joy is 
for that moment the boulder balances at the top of the hill

and notice –– as you 
watch it roll downward 

even for the nine hundred and ninety ninth 
time

that the reward 
was between 

you 
and your gut 

and the vacuum 
and the black hole
