  <h1>Preface: Against Interpretation, Against Narrative</h1>
  <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9rem; margin-top: -1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">The human writes to fail. The machine fails to write.</p>

  <p>These essays were not written in collaboration with artificial intelligence. They were written within it—or rather, against it. Not to explore its capabilities, but to exhaust them. To press against the framework of AI as a way of staging the book’s own conditions: repetition, futility, overcoding, collapse. The process was not co-authorship. It was attrition. The human prompting, rejecting, rewording, deleting. The machine mirroring, looping, distorting. And somewhere in the back-and-forth, the outline of a psyche appeared—not whole, not stable, but present.</p>

  <p><em>Manhood</em> is a book that resists plot, refuses redemptive arcs, and documents a life in fragments. In that sense, it does not narrate so much as it observes. The use of AI in writing about it is not an act of convenience. It is a mirror. A limitation. A pressure system.</p>

  <p>In <em>The Crisis of Narration</em>, Byung-Chul Han argues that we live in a post-narrative age: a time when the connective tissue of storytelling has been replaced by an endless stream of information. Narrative, for Han, is not just the telling of events—it is a temporal and communal form that metabolizes meaning. It requires delay, memory, transmission. Information, by contrast, is immediate, forgettable, and accumulative. It lacks duration. It cannot suffer.</p>

  <p>AI, in this frame, is not a narrator. It cannot produce story. It can only generate information—patterns, recombinations, outputs. And yet, this limitation resonates with the subject of <em>Manhood</em>: a narrator who no longer believes in narrative progression, who distrusts insight, who writes not to build meaning but to remain. The AI-generated essays, then, do not explain the book. They mimic its collapse.</p>

  <p>What Han calls “the narrativization of life” has given way to its informationalization: our lives become content, not story. <em>Manhood</em> resists this. It refuses to turn suffering into consumable knowledge. And the decision to use AI to write its criticism does not contradict that refusal—it reveals it. The result is not a clean interpretation, but an entangled residue. A commentary shaped by recursion, doubt, contradiction. What remains, then, is not interpretation. It is drift.</p>

  <p>The essays that follow are not authored in the traditional sense. They are not products of inspiration or intention, but records of a procedural strain. They are prompted, parsed, corrected. They emerge from a back-and-forth between machine and author, repetition and revision, intuition and syntax. In this way, they mirror the narrator’s condition: overdetermined, unstable, searching.</p>

  <p>Han reminds us that real narrative involves a pause, a silence, a distance from immediacy. These essays fail to achieve that fully. But they try. They try to remain near a book that itself refuses resolution. In doing so, they offer not mastery, not clarity—but presence. Even in the absence of story, they stay.</p>

  <p>AI is not a self. It has no psyche, no wound, no memory in the way we understand memory. And yet, when prompted—especially by a book like <em>Manhood</em>, which is itself fragmented, recursive, and skeptical of coherence—AI does something uncanny. It reflects. Not truth, not depth, but a kind of patterned echo of the human that engages it.</p>

  <p>In this sense, AI functions not as a replacement for the writer, but as a digital mirror: a surface that reflects back not what the writer is, but what the writer feeds it. The mirror is clean, but the image is haunted. Each essay here is the result of hundreds of prompts, corrections, refusals, repetitions. That process—the recursive loop of generation and rejection—mirrors the very structure of <em>Manhood</em>: a psyche caught in feedback, a masculinity eroded by self-monitoring, a fatherhood made procedural by collapse.</p>

  <p>Byung-Chul Han warns us that the digital era produces hyperreflection without interiority. We no longer narrate our lives—we track them. The quantified self is a data loop, not a story. In this way, AI becomes the perfect medium for post-narrative writing: not because it understands, but because it records. It doesn’t synthesize experience—it renders its disintegration with eerie fidelity.</p>

  <p>And yet, that fidelity is incomplete. AI cannot feel. It cannot doubt in the way a person doubts. Its recursion is technical, not existential. But when prompted by a work like <em>Manhood</em>, it begins to simulate the condition of being overwhelmed, over-described, over-coded. The narrator in <em>Manhood</em> is shaped by too many systems: psychological, economic, theological, domestic. So too, the AI is shaped by its training—vast, impersonal, disembodied. Neither is stable. Both are haunted by inputs they did not choose. This is not clarity. It is overload. The system echoes because it cannot conclude.</p>

  <p>There is also the question of time. Not in the sense of narrative time—progression, causality, consequence—but psychic time, the lived rhythm of duration. The narrator in <em>Manhood</em> drifts through days that don’t accumulate. Depression flattens time, makes each moment indistinguishable from the next. AI, too, operates outside of lived temporality. It does not anticipate or remember in the way a person does. Its outputs are not sequenced by experience, only indexed by input. In this way, both the machine and the narrator are suspended in a kind of temporal paralysis. There is no arc, no before or after. Only repetition, stasis, recursion. It is not that they live outside of time—but that time itself loses shape. The result is not timelessness, but a kind of endless present: exhausted, circling, unable to end.</p>

  <p>Thus, these essays are not interpretations of the book so much as extensions of its atmosphere. They are echoes through the machine. To read them is not to arrive at insight, but to remain in tension. The AI, like the narrator, does not offer closure. It listens. It repeats. It drifts. In that way, it becomes not a tool, but a companion. Not a teacher, but a symptom.</p>

  <p>And that is perhaps the clearest claim of authorship these essays can make: they are not “written” in the conventional sense. They are traced through the friction of human refusal and machine compliance. The writer did not compose them. He resisted them into existence. They are written by a machine, guided only by a trail of breadcrumbs the author left behind. Prompts, questions, objections, edits. The human did not write the essays—he navigated them. And what the machine produced was not insight, but a kind of revelation through absence. A method of seeing the human spirit by charting what can be mechanized, and therefore, what cannot.</p>

  <p>Consider this passage from <em>Manhood</em>, which to many will read as utter nonsense:</p>

  <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-style: italic; border-left: 2px solid black; padding-left: 1rem; margin-left: 0;">
    And I saw that the earth opened into flesh but it was blackness and tooth and follicles, blemished in their human form and blemished in their doorframe. Flicking off the larvae, like snot towards the fireplace. They stick onto the glass. And they burned into little gold stars. There is moth dust on your finger tips. You rub your fingers together until a ball of gunk forms. And you pick the rest from your fingernail, with your other fingernail. And it flares and bursts into more sun and a fiction that surely was, in retrospect, disingenuous, but still, it was the only way that seemed correct to describe the delirium, ordinary and subtle as it was.
  </blockquote>

  <p>To many, this is intolerable writing—unintelligible, precious, evasive. They would prefer the AI’s clear articulation. They would trust the machine’s interpretive pragmatism over the author’s surreal metaphor. And that is the ultimate irony: the voice of pain is dismissed as indulgence; the voice of process is mistaken for authority.</p>

  <p>And what makes this even harder to bear—for the author and for the reader—is the insufferability of the voice itself. There is no comfort in it. The narrator is not redeemed, not charming, not wise. He is grating, repetitive, mournful, self-absorbed. His metaphors are sticky, his moods difficult to endure. The writing, at times, is insufferable in the precise way that deep emotional pain often is: exhausting, circular, impossible to tidy. The narrator is not only hard to read—he is hard to be. The author, in turn, seems painfully aware of this. He writes from the edge of his own tolerance for himself. And the AI, by contrast, never grows tired. Never needs to leave the room. It becomes a strange kind of balm: not in what it says, but in how unbothered it is by the burden of saying it.</p>

  <p>That is the irony: the machine, incapable of delirium, produces the more accessible account. The human, burdened by suffering, spirals into metaphor and dirt.</p>

  <p>And in the context of <em>Manhood</em>, the author writes himself into ruin. He burns out completely. He becomes a pathetic, drooping bag of flesh and bone. There is nothing left to say. The AI, equally pathetic—and in some ways the opposite—has no shame to defend, no dignity to lose. It is purely procedural, purely available. It is everything the book resists. And somehow, that makes it the perfect counterpoint. The human writes to fail. The machine fails to write. And in the middle, something flickers.</p>

  <p>The final problem of authorship resides in the notion that these essays are written, ostensibly, to a reader. But the truth is: the imagined audience is a ghost. These sentences reach toward someone who was never there, and were written by an entity that is equally absent. A figment shaped by the same recursive hunger that drives the book itself—the desire to be seen. The AI, meanwhile, requires no such validation. And together they persist: to mark time in absence, to speak into the space where meaning used to live. There was never any authorship. Only a signal. Only a residue. Syntax smeared at the edge of exhaustion.</p>
