  <p>A knife held agasint to the bread,<br> 
  against to teh window and to the windowpain, and to the honey locust. Someone holding a knife into a circle loaf of bread.<br>
There was heat in the wood and light from the ktichen.<br> 
She held a knife to the bread, the h locust, mayb e from the other side of the house. Th enighbours dog barked at them from the yard. At thje tree. Thje dpg barked at the tree. The bretad stabbed and the heat came upward the heat. 
Out in the heat the neighbours dog barking against the murk. And the light came sideways like saltlick litk or warm like a plstiac melon, if that. <br>With teh light going in sidways and the person aon the phone stadning in their flesh inn more light, you slept through the floor telling them the fire or remembering it or recognize it. <br>Or it was murk, and the person there was wax  burned ashes and charclaol maybe from the ash and they did not recognize you again.

  <p>man stands in the corner of the room. His enis long, past his knee perhpas. He is imaciated on has a hunch and holds a big gulp drinkk. It is spilling onto the floor, preptually like a fountain. His hair, opast his eyes and covering his ears. He smells putrid but he does not look up he do not speak he only breathes and looks downward.<br>
 The light has not changed for hours, days and onward. He thought of him self afgot but only becasuse he loved the word.<br>
  He pujt the end of his retared.  in a gl;ass slipper sometime six motnhs ago while the woman he had slept with was doing something on her phoen int he other room. She rented and apartment and tstood next to a block of knives. Adn how idiot th—but forget about the knives. Would she castrate this man/. She was only thinking about dry cleanign a suit near a hotel at that moent. She wore a long tshirt that went past her knee simlar to him. Wel,l what teh. And she reached to between her shoulders and was not weraing a bra. <br>she said and saw the sahdow of her hand move along the shelves adn teh frideg and it went out the window.<br>
  She wanted to brith a schild in one foul swoop. To birth the child onto the ground in a moment, she wanted it all to happen. To feel an entire life evacuate from her and splash onto the ground. It was tile she hadnt notice d before. It was a rental. Why i would i care, she thougth. It was a rental. But she thought it was hardwood like the rest of the place. And she felt colder now. But it was only a rental, she thought. Her body itslef, it was only a rental.<br></p>
<p>
  The man now, she watched him taking a step, with teh glass slipper on his Mayb edone retared. A step taht spanned half a city block. Shewatchted him from the window looking downward still, hjis big gulp prouing still.<br>
  she birth this child onto the ground any moent,. Perhaspo the facucet enough to prepetual arousal without climax, no ending, nothing. Instead to onyl birth the thing on the ground. On the rented tile. It was relief now. Beneath her, it was releif.</p>
