As it stood then. no second child on the horizon. </p>
The of. Of going through pregnancy againf going the delivery h a new infant. in the future. 
But in fact, there was nothing in the future. Except my office. In my chair. By the window. Thinking of what there is to write. Drinking coffee. </p>

I . In ways. It seems that all of my love is already used up hat I already have more than I have known before. That there is not room for another. But it seems that there is room for me. </p>


<p>an event at Nora’s daycare. A passover sederNora sat between two girls. She ate the snacks off her plate. Charoset.melon and grapes. Matzoh with sprinkles on it. She watched as the teachers acted out the story of passover. Her legs swung back and forth from the chair. 
They talked about they were slaves.  those years ago. How they had to carry bricks in the hot sun. he land of the pyramids. 
the rest thinking of my own youth. parts of the story. Here and there. 
</p>

<p>

thes biblical resistant t it seemed  
Being in the room. Remembering this stuff Miriam and I sat behind Nora. All of these all wieach other. Making these kids. How they could seem.  We were in this synagogue.  

And the teachers separated it. Like how they separated the water, to get out of there. to escape </p>

<p>
Golden calf and disbelief as a form of belief. maybe that whole thing bloom put together. 

 they must 
in their time. external forces imposed control. but we,
<br>
maybe there is something to be said.  beyond you for the most part. these things is very strange. 
<br>
and it seems that is intolerable for some. who believe that god is in control. 
 <br>
then we split the water open . 
it seems so meaingless and spread out in a way.</p>
<p>
the rest of,i have a hard time remembering the details. and then one day i came home and we were going to go out to a movie there are people that seem to be in the trash bin to me. they are few and far between. as that is how it must be.  redemption through others. and when i demanded more clarity , clearly. </p>

<p>
 i went to the drug store to get some polysporin for nora. she had a scrape on her cheek that seems to be infected.
they werent open for half an hour or so. so i went and sat with a cup of coffee.
how much cream i would like. becsue he recognized how often i would go. he was kind and i was sure to thank him again on the way out.
when i was there i sat by the window and watched the traffic. i watcehd the bus pull up and peopel get on and off. it was meanignless to watch them for the most part.
and i had a glimpse into some past the ordinary. 
i sat until the drug store opened. i bought polysporin and some minnie mouse band aids for her.
i drove back, getting stuck in some rush hour along the way.
when i got home nora and miriam were eating eggs at the table. i could see her eye was a bit swollen. we played with her elmo toy and cookie mosnter toy. and then we read her little mermaid book. she didnt want to put her jacket on.  miriam was getting more frustrated. leaving the house. i had left my shoes in the mud room and she stepped on them to get out.</p>
<p>
she said that nora was very sad for her to leave at daycare. but i will go get her early today. to take her to the doctor. to make sure she is ok.
</p>
i picked her up they said she was sad and not acting like herself. that she was asking for miriam and yaya all day. that she wouldnt really play with anyone. that she was sad. i took her into the car and she kept saying she wanted to go home. but we had to go to the doctor’s office.
i reminded her of the curious george book where he goes to the hospital from having a stomach ache. and i said we had to go to the doctor too, to help her cheek.
i found a parking spot a couple blocks away. i carried her and seh kept saying she wanted to go home. but i tried to distract her talking about toys and games we play.
they told us to go to room 5. i brought her there. she didnt want to sit on the table. instead she sat on my lap. we ate her chips. and i showed her some stickers i had in my pocket. dumbo. the little mermaid and sebastian. when the doctor came in, nora was very shy. i explained the thing on her cheek. how it had been spreading as it had.
she said it was common and she prescribed a topical antibiotic. i carried nora back to the car. it was windy and she told me again that she wanted to go home. that she wanted to see yaya. she wanted to see yaya.
</P>
<p>
eventually the pharmacy called, her prescription was ready. i drove down there. freezing rain. snow. i drove slowly. parking where i did this morning. i went in to the back of the store. a glimpse of a memory of what it was like to work in a store while there is a storm outside. i waited behind some guy for a few minutes
i am here ot pick up a prescription for my daughter, i said to the pharmacist. and showed him her health card. he looked at the rack of packages. finding hers not at the end of the first one but at the beginning of the second.
he explained everythign about it to me. to apply it twice or even three times in a day. he said it was the best topical antibiotic they had. it cost 35 dollars. miriam’s insurance would pay for it. i bought some ketchup chips on the way out and ate them on the drive home.
a woman thought that i was going to hit her even though i was fully stopped waiting for her to cross the street.
nora she was very tired. still with impetigo.
we played with her toys and built little houses and she smashed them all
finally we got outside and she fell asleep almost instantly in her green car
and then i turned around and tried to get her to sleep in the crib.
she finally did and then after about 30 min she started crying.
she is crying now an calling for mama. it seems like maybe though. after about 5 or 10 minutes of this she has fallen asleep again.
the scab on her cheek is healing some. we’ll keep with the antibiotics. its still spread a bit
miriam asked how we were doing
we finally got out of the house at about 1030.. she fell asleep almost instantly in green car, i was able to carry her back into the house while sleeping and got off her jacket and hat but then the second i put her down in the crib she started crying. got milk read stories sang songs and then she fell asleep at about 1100… at 1130 she started crying and shnuffling but thankfully connected and now is back to sleep again
and now i am eating baby carrots while sitting next to the monitor. i am sitting trying to get some writing in.
i hope she can catch up on some sleep.
she is crying again. asking for mama. turning around and around. i hope she can sleep again. but she is sitting up now.
i dont know how to explain how it feels. when she is crying and asking for her mom. it is this kind of conflict… it is different than anything else.
she is getting more hysterical now. screaming for mama. but she keeps lying down and trying to sleep. so i don’t want to go in there, to disturb her. but i’m worried she’s getting to be too distressed.
she wants milk. she is saying milk milk. maybe i will bring her a bottle. i need milk, she says. but she is lying down now. holding her bunny’s hand. she is settling. hopefully she will want to eat more when she wakes up but she didn’t seem to have much of an appetite before.


<p>
A new tiny punctate focus of enhancement is also seen in the deep left frontoparietal white matter just lateral to the body of left lateral ventricle.
Extensive T2/FLAIR signal abnormality in the left cerebral hemispheric white matter is similar in extent compared to previous.
Ventricular caliber is normal. No hydrocephalus.
Left sphenoid sinus mucous retention cyst is unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
Adverse interval change with a new enhancing focus in the left cerebellar hemisphere and deep left cerebral hemispheric white matter, and increase in the previously demonstrated enhancement along the temporal horn of the left lateral ventricle. The known enhancing foci along the anteromedial aspect of the resection cavity and along the undersurface of the left tentorial leaflet are unchanged. Overall, the findings raise concern for new/progressive disease.

A new enhancing lesion in the deep left frontoparietal white matter can potentially affect several important functions, depending on its exact location and size. 

</p>

<p>
⸻

Left Frontoparietal White Matter

This area lies deep between the frontal and parietal lobes on the left side of the brain, and involves white matter, which is responsible for transmitting signals between different brain regions.

Potential Functional Effects

The left frontoparietal region is involved in a range of important functions, and a lesion here could potentially affect:

1. Motor Control (especially right side of the body)
	•	The frontal lobe—especially its posterior portion—houses the motor cortex.
	•	A lesion here could cause:
	•	Weakness or clumsiness on the right side of the body, especially the arm or leg.
	•	Fine motor control issues.

2. Sensory Processing
	•	The parietal lobe processes touch, pressure, temperature, and proprioception (body position).
	•	A lesion may cause:
	•	Numbness, tingling, or loss of sensation on the right side of the body.

3. Language (if near Broca’s area)
	•	On the left side, the frontal lobe may include or be near Broca’s area, which is crucial for language production.
	•	A lesion here may affect:
	•	Speech fluency, leading to expressive aphasia (trouble forming words/sentences).

4. Cognitive/Executive Function
	•	The frontal lobe supports:
	•	Planning
	•	Problem-solving
	•	Attention
	•	Decision-making
	•	A lesion might lead to:
	•	Cognitive slowing
	•	Difficulty concentrating or organizing thoughts

5. White Matter Tracts (Signal Transmission)
	•	White matter carries information between parts of the brain and between the brain and spinal cord.
	•	Damage may result in:
	•	Slower processing speed
	•	Coordination problems
	•	Disrupted connectivity between brain regions

then cobblestones unevenly between narrow buildings. Garments above the street, strung from window to window. Stone walls cracked, patched. A child past, carrying a basket lined with cloth. Two men in heavy coats walk side by side, one speaking quietly with missing teeth. Their hands worn, the skin dry and ridged at the knuckles.
</p>
<p>
A face appears, his hat is stiff and perched his eyes downcast, the creases of his face folding in toward the mouth, which is fixed in a slight  fatigue, or ambient pain, Behind him, others pass in distraction mostly men in coats holding parcels or pushing carts.

<p>
In the market, crates, and boards.  shoes, eggs, buttons, cloth. A girl, barefoot, holds a duck to her chest. The animal shifts A man kneels to re-tie a parcel of fish wrapped in newspaper. Children work alongside adults.  Hands gesture  abbreviated  A boy with chapped lips bites at a knuckle watching his mother bargain for carrots.
</p>
<p>
Meat traded from crates. Feathers cling the edges of wooden boxes. A butcher folds a stained apron over itself and slides it into a satchel. He nods at a man holding two birds by the feet.  a woman counts apples into a bag with one hand, resting the other on a small child’s head.
</p>

<p>
man faces forward. His brow  raised, the irises centered. He does not smile. His beard is patchy and grey. The collar of his coat is pulled against the cold. He looks as if waiting for something to pass—not from resistance, but from habit. Behind him, motion continues.
</p>
<p>
Homes are constructed upper levels leaning inward. In  stairwell, a woman prepares food on a stool. Her knife is short, the blade dull. boiling grain rises through the walls.  a table is surrounded by people eating soup. The table leans one leg is balanced on a piece of firewood. The young dips bread and wipes her mouth with her sleeve. The broth marrow and ash by a stove, reading from a worn book, lips moving in silence. A bucket of water  A folded cloth rests on the windowsill On the wall plaster.

<p>
walk through a stone corridor. They are dressed formally but in worn clothes. Each one moves without speaking. Their eyes are focused ahead. One adjusts his glasses. Another carries a case, the handle wrapped in twine. They do not look like they are arriving anywhere. Their gait is rehearsed, with no visible urgency or hesitation—simply transit.
</p>
<p>
a narrow , men stand in rhythmic motion, holding small books. Some wear shawls with knotted threads at the corners. A boy in the corner mimics their motion without a book. The oldest man’s lips are cracked and red. A smaller box is wrapped around his arm in tight leather straps. Others nod along with the text. Some whisper. None speak aloud.
</p>
<p>

Elsewhere, a butcher stands over a calf. Blood pools into a metal tray. The animal’s body remains limp. No one speaks. A boy waits nearby with a cloth. Later, the meat is portioned into sacks. Bones are burned. Water is brought
Outside, bricks are stacked beside a demolished wall. Men move them in wheelbarrows. a uses a torn sack to cushion his shoulder. Behind them, a child carries a wooden slat and drags a bucket with both hands. Dust clings to the creases of faces. sweat wipes with their sleeves.
</p>
<p>
There is motion between cities. Groups arrive with bundles wrapped in cloth, suitcases with broken handles, pillowcases tied in knots. One woman wears two coats layered. A man holds a loaf of bread under his coat. Shoes are reinforced with string. Children are quiet. The bundles smell of smoke and soap.
</p>

<p>
A man sits in profile. His eyes are closed. The side of his face is smooth, cheeks full. His hair is neat, combed back. A cigarette dangles loosely. He does not appear ill, nor especially old—just still. His breath moves the ash slightly. He seems unaware of the observer.
</p>

<p>
On arrival, posture shifts. Eyes dart upward. They scan windows, signs, corners. A young boy smooths his hair with a cupped hand. A woman adjusts her collar repeatedly, as though not used to the fit. People stand in doorways before entering. The pace of speech changes—shorter, clipped. Hands are kept in pockets. Movement becomes contained.
</p>

<p>
Stone blocks rise from the ground. Some lean against them, touching them with open palms. Others place their heads forward, murmuring into the cracks. Paper scraps are folded tightly and inserted between the stones. One man weeps without sound. A woman holds the hand of a child who keeps glancing at the adults, unsure of what is expected. He eventually sits and traces a shape into the dust with his finger.
</p>
<p>
A room. lit Three men seated around a small table. They lean slightly inward. One gestures with a bent hand. The others listen their eyes drift. A coat folded over the chair. The floor  Behind them, a child sleeps, curled into a wall. The space worn  between stove and basin, the polish on one armrest.
</p>
<p>
In the courtyard, a man kneels beside a calf. Another hand holds a shallow basin. The animal stiffens. Blood is caught, poured. The body is washed.  Bones are separated with a cleaver. Potatoes are peeled directly into the fire. Soup simmers. Onion skins are swept into a corner
</p>
<p>
a man stands with one hand raised in mid-gesture. He is young, clean-shaven, wearing a uniform with polished buttons. Behind him, a crowd repeats his stance. The light catches on their forearms. In the distance, flags wave. The movement is synchronized, like breath.
</p>
<p>
A boy tugs at his mother’s sleeve. She kneels, wipes his nose with her scarf, then kisses his forehead. She holds his chin for a moment. Her thumb lingers near his mouth. He leans into her. Then they both stand.
</p>

<p>
A man he pretends not to notice. He cups the match carefully, He inhales once, then turns away from the group.
Candles are lit. Bread is passed. A child sings off-key and is gently corrected. Two elders begin a prayer. Their voices tremble. The others fall silent. The child watches their mouths. Outside, snow has begun to fall lightly on the sill.
</p>

<p>
The calf’s neck,  again, is pulled back and held. A blade moves and The blood collects in a tin bowl.  The calf’s body is dragged away the prayer is replaced with the mouth of the animal in spasm. Then, with the mouth of the state

</p>
    <p>Cobblestones run unevenly between narrow buildings. Garments sway above the street, strung from window to window. The air smells faintly of damp fabric and coal smoke. Children dart between legs,  against the clatter of carts and the murmur of merchants hawking wares.</p>

<p>
she is quieter now. hiccuping.<br>
never mind she is up. i will bring her milk<br>
i filled the bottle watching the monitor. she cried more for mama mama mama.<br>
but now, perhaps she has settled again.<br>
her mama is at work. she is downtown, sitting in an office going through paperwork.<br>
dada is here, watching her on the monitor with a bottle of milk. i suppose this inadequacy.<br>
she is still trying to get back to sleep. it is so chaotic watching it. its kind of a panic and then a relief and a hope and a disappointment. and a sadness for her. and an annoyance. it is all of that.<br>
it is noon now. she is hugging her bunny and she has been quiet for a little bit longer.<br>
if she could sleep another hour or two. it would be so good for her.
maybe i’ll make us pizza for lunch instead of dinner. we can have something else then. or maybe just yogurt and granola like usual. i dont know.<br>
I am standing outside of her room. She is still lying down. Trying to sleep I can’t see if her eyes are open or not. But she is crying for mama and then quiet. It is painful to let her cry but she needs her sleep to get better. As soon as she stands up I’ll be in there with milk. And it’s getting close but she still sems like she’s trying to rest.<br>
of being a parent.  of  crying child.
She is trying to sleep. But crying for mama. It has been going on much more than usual. There is a construction crew outside, fixing the road. I don’t think she can hear the noises over the white noise but it is loud
It seems that she may have fallen asleep again. If she was sitting up and standing I would go in but she keeps trying to sleep. And really it is only her nap time now. I would only be bringing her back from daycare usually she has been quiet for a bit. I think she may have fallen asleep again. Now. If she can go another hour, or even half an hour. Her schedule has a chance of getting back in order.
I think she is asleep now. I am in the hallway outside her room l. Her white noise in one ear and the jackhammer breaking through the concrete in my other. But she is sleeping. It seems we have done it Nori. sleep now, baby girl</P>
