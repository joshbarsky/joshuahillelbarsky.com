when i woke up i put my sunglasses on and proceeded to cry on and off until my wife and daughter got home around lunch time. 
i took nora on a walk in her green car. we went to the coffee shop and she drank a small cup of milk and i drank my coffee it is something we’ve been doing lately. 

Looping – A trauma-driven cycle of disrespect, invalidation, rage, shame, and collapse
Flooded – Nervous system overwhelmed beyond verbal processing
Shutdown – Emotional flatlining and disengagement
Disengaged – Emotionally absent despite physical presence
Repair – A relational gesture that acknowledges rupture
Validation – Recognizing emotional reality even without full agreement
Invalidation – Dismissing or downplaying another’s felt experience
Containment – Providing calm presence without trying to fix or mirror
Differentiation – Remaining self-anchored while engaging with others’ emotions
Reenactment – Playing out old relational wounds unconsciously in current dynamics
Triangulation – Indirect communication where a third party is used to manage tension
Boundary – A limit set to protect emotional safety, not to control others

i felt ashamed and embarrassed of my last novel. i felt the hopelessness of it ever becoming anything that i had hoped it would. i imagined publishers and agents opening it in their inboxes and feeling embarrassed of their humanity for even seeing the email. 
i do not think of god laughing but more so him being calm and saying that failure, as a writer was what was best for me. </p>
<p>

    i have memories of being a young boy and waking up in the middle of the night in a terror and a feeling that everyone thought i was worthless and it was hopeless that i would find my way in the world. 
the same thing happened last night. i woke up at around 230 and cried to my wife in more or less the same state. 
i dont know exactly what kind of inner child work would be prescribed. 

ok everything is good in this document now. 
not everythign but a good amount. 
i will figure out how to get it together




proxy dehumanization 
the reduction or erasure of a subjectiveitly due to their proximity to trauma
to ilness to disabiltiy or other specific experience 
not de humanized for intrinsic identity or action but towards adjacenty to suffering 
others proejct hyperbolic meaning or discomfort onto them, rendering them represntanitve rather than an individual 

witness avoidance
a relational defence mechanism wherin indvividulas withdcradraw from those suffering or adjectent to suffering
not from malice but from fear, reverence or perceived inadequacy 
the avboidanec is often rationalized as respect but results in abandon ment

reverential., estrangment 
a compound relational phenomenon rseutling fromt the interaction of proxy dehumanization and witness avoidance

the subject is haeld at a distance — mytholgized, idealized, feard 
producing sopcial isolation under the guise of admiration ro respect, effectively silencing the lived experience of the person 

affective economoy of pain 
a sociocultural system in which emotional suffering is treated as a legible commodity 
empathy, v alidation and witness are allocated baed on tee based on the periceived coherence, narratibilty or social acceptability of one’s pain 
liegbile pain is accord value, illegible pain is discounted
individulas may learn to perform, tranlate or curuate their suffering to gain access to support 

zero sum suffering 
a cognitive and cultural shcema in whcich empathy is believe to be a finitie resource 
care for one person is perceived to reduce avialbe care for others 
this leads to competition, self silencing and guilt

ciomparative suffering
the act of ranking differnt forms of suffering often resulting int he minimaxiation of one’s own pain or the dismissal of others
may be self imposed 
it discourages vulnerabilyut, obscures nuance and invalidates subtler forms of distress
often leads to emotioanl seelf censorship, guilty and disconnection from support systems 

hierarhcies of suffering 
a systemic or interpoersonal stratificaiton of pain based on percieved legitmacy 
sufering is ordered according to visibiltiy, identiyt markers, diagnoistc clarity or social utitlity 
the strafiication govern saccess to attention, epathy and institutualnal care
subdomonit or non normative experiences are freqently relegated to the margins
