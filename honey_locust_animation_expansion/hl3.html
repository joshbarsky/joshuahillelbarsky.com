  <p>The field, as posture oasture.</p>
  <p>Th grfrit grift, not idetail. Outside can carry the grtif grift.</p> 
  <p>Those podfs manual person of wan in detail, parenting all other loves seemed disfigure.
  The mornig disgfigured the clears.</p>
<br>
  <p>political animals. we must assimilate and reconcile with the others. your worldview. The one you were born into. It seems like, there is too much excitement. Too much adding and not enough taking away. 
  <p>To become lost in the mere of things. To create another version of yourself. A new version. And so. And so on.</p>
<br>
  <p>Some months had passed.</p>
  <p>You imagined a field. You imagined the city you grew up in. The dirt before the grass came.</p>
<p>You were young, and you did not know that you never would. You were young and the boredom you felt seemed to attune you to a discomfort and a knowingness, that you lacked knowingness.</p>
  <p>The world would change around you. And one day you would realize that you would not be able to return to it. They tried to call it stillness. But you knew that was not what it was at all. You were alone in the field. And you did not know its value or the poison that it was.</p>
  <p>Being among others would become difficult. You were a thorn or a prick, or something prickling. No community. No real motion towards good. No slave, no master. A glimpse of a self. But in relation to no one it was more or less, redundant.</p>
  <p>Unless God was your master.<br>
  Or that you were the master of God. More rain, more locusts. No origin of rain. No origin of locusts. The slave and the master and the Ox and the God. And man, himself. Standing in the field. And the Ox. No humility. Only strength. There is an Ox there, the man said. And he walked towards the Ox and he walked the Ox through the field. And the Ox surrendered. And the Ox led him and he become yoked to it.</p>
<br>
  <p>Across the field. There were men there, and slaves and women and a god. They were together. And they had a sense of what was good. And together they were a body. They were limbs and a spine and a mind.</p>
  <p>And detached — they were dead objects. Each finger and intestine, were equally sufficient and reliant. And that made them resilient. And so the cycle moved. If the body was destroyed, the hand and the foot may exist. But not as a hand or foot anymore. Because their function was tied to the body. And their meaning was tied to the body.</p>
  <p>Detached from the body, without function, they could not see the man as human. They saw there in the field, that the Ox and the man were one. He was either a beast or a God. But he was not a political animal.</p>
  <p>And he watched the State. With his Ox. He saw there were some there, who saw their function to be their wealth. He saw that their wealth would protect the greater whole. And he saw there were others that took only what was needed. And he saw that their modesty would protect the greater whole.</p>
  <p>The strength and humility and the hubris and the stillness of being. They looked at you, with your Ox in the field and they did not know if you were a God or a beast. And the dubiousness, of the whole, you were unsure what that meant. If the contrast between them was a virtue or if it was inharmonious, if it was naive. It seemed they could not settle with the idea that they could not know.</p>
  <p>Would they keep their wealth in their pocket. Or should they pay it back. The sheath that you found, in the dirt rusting. And with no arm to swing it, it may be called a sheath, but it was not a sheath at all. Like you it was defined by its work and its power. And so without any work or power, you were defined by nothing. And without it you could not accelerate, you could not exhaust. You could only turn. You could only return to a place you never left.</P
<p>But the Ox plowed, yolked. Circling the field. To reset with the movement of the sun. As ritual, and as burden. And as surrender, and as God.</p>
